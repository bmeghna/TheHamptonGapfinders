A level area approximately 70% built up. It is park like in general appearance. Many of the streets are winding and attractive, but all are poorly lighted, which is a common fault in all Norfolk neighborhoods. The central portion of the area, known as Glencove, is the principal scene of present construction activity. A special assessment has been agreed upon for this area in consideration of street improvements, which will expire in 1946. All construction is sound and the population is stable, with excellent pride of home ownership evident in the maintenance of lawns and shrubbory. Hampton Boulevard, through the center of the area, is a thoroughfare to the Naval Operating Base and the Newport News ferry. There are several apartment houses on this street, of three and four room suites renting from $45 to $50 per unit per month, and a street car line which takes about 25 minutes to downtown Norfolk. The area is cool in summer because of prevailing winds from the southwest. The Norfolk Country Club and tennis courts are located within the area, and the gold course is approximately 1 mile northeast. Schools, churches, neighborhood stores convenient.","9":"Lockhaven, Glencove, Meadowbrook (Norfolk) 1st A-1 Nov. 1939","71":"9","72":"$25.00","1a":"Slowly N/A N/A","1b":"Executives, naval officers, professional, $4,000-15,000","1c":"0% N/A","1d":"0%","1e":"none","2a":"1-family 2 story, 7-10 rooms 2-family 5/5 room on Hampton Blvd.","2b":"frame - brick frame","2c":"15 years 6 years","2d":"good good","2e":"98% 98%","2f":"90% 5%","2g":"7500 to 11000 9250 to 12000","2h":"7750 to 11500 =+4% 9500 to 12500 =+4%","2i":"1939 8000 to 12000 =+4% 9500 to 12500 0%","2j":"fair to good fair","2k":"firm firm","2l":"65 to 85 62.5 to 80","2m":"70 to 90 7% 62.5 to 80 0%","2n":"1939 75 to 100 =+9% 65 to 85 =+5%","2o":"good good","2p":"firm firm","4a":"0","4b":"5","5a":"0","5b":"12"}}},{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"MultiPolygon","coordinates":[[[[-76.286207,36.905513],[-76.285654,36.905431],[-76.285249,36.905543],[-76.284913,36.905484],[-76.284662,36.905228],[-76.284304,36.905234],[-76.283815,36.905582],[-76.282417,36.905271],[-76.282367,36.905255],[-76.2819,36.905117],[-76.278647,36.904147],[-76.277467,36.903801],[-76.277468,36.903799],[-76.277695,36.903332],[-76.27856,36.901363],[-76.279673,36.89874],[-76.279679,36.89874],[-76.281986,36.89899],[-76.284211,36.899361],[-76.285673,36.899634],[-76.287098,36.899907],[-76.287207,36.900148],[-76.287177,36.900313],[-76.286436,36.900752],[-76.285979,36.901128],[-76.285205,36.901421],[-76.284546,36.901448],[-76.284104,36.901664],[-76.284229,36.901753],[-76.285117,36.901801],[-76.285508,36.901818],[-76.286585,36.901579],[-76.287156,36.901448],[-76.287514,36.90157],[-76.287805,36.901887],[-76.287871,36.902282],[-76.288461,36.903364],[-76.288465,36.903565],[-76.288168,36.903993],[-76.287926,36.903962],[-76.287648,36.903478],[-76.287227,36.903039],[-76.287009,36.902871],[-76.286864,36.903004],[-76.286935,36.903398],[-76.287249,36.904025],[-76.287812,36.904373],[-76.287997,36.904641],[-76.28804,36.904897],[-76.287765,36.90515],[-76.287256,36.905576],[-76.286835,36.905644],[-76.286207,36.905513]]]]},"properties":{"name":null,"holc_id":"A2","holc_grade":"A","area_description_data":{"2":"100% N/A","3":"20 1-family, $6,000-10,000 Mostly built to order","5":"4","6":"ample","8":"This is one of the few new developments in the Norfolk-Portsmouth-Newport News area to warrant the highest classification.

The population is stable and evidences good pride of home ownership in the maintenance of lawns and shrubbery.","9":"Talbot Park 1st A-2 Dec. 1939","71":"9","72":"$25.00","1a":"Slowly N/A N/A","1b":"Executives - professional - $4,000-6,000","1c":"0% N/A","1d":"0%","1e":"none","2a":"1-family 2 story, 7-room N/A","2b":"frame - brick N/A","2c":"2 years N/A","2d":"good N/A","2e":"95% N/A","2f":"100% N/A","2g":"none built N/A","2h":"6000 to 10000 - N/A N/A","2i":"1939 6000 to 10000 0% N/A N/A","2j":"fair - good N/A","2k":"firm N/A","2l":"none rented N/A","2m":"N/A N/A N/A N/A","2n":"N/A N/A N/A N/A N/A","2o":"N/A N/A","2p":"N/A N/A","4a":"0","4b":"0","5a":"0","5b":"0"}}},{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"MultiPolygon","coordinates":[[[[-76.365226,37.007308],[-76.360857,37.007651],[-76.36041,37.00352],[-76.356689,37.00491],[-76.356668,37.004815],[-76.35643,37.003536],[-76.359226,37.002823],[-76.362825,37.002198],[-76.363509,37.001871],[-76.364134,37.001722],[-76.364907,37.001514],[-76.365502,37.001276],[-76.366364,37.000979],[-76.367376,37.000622],[-76.368149,37.000443],[-76.368922,37.000086],[-76.369666,36.999819],[-76.370558,36.999551],[-76.373354,36.999551],[-76.374246,36.999491],[-76.376358,36.99851],[-76.378678,36.997469],[-76.380701,37.000354],[-76.381034,37.0007],[-76.381474,37.001157],[-76.379243,37.002406],[-76.376328,37.003953],[-76.376715,37.004488],[-76.378381,37.003626],[-76.378708,37.004072],[-76.379095,37.003923],[-76.379868,37.005291],[-76.376685,37.007165],[-76.376209,37.007492],[-76.375823,37.007701],[-76.375258,37.007909],[-76.374365,37.008504],[-76.373949,37.00889],[-76.373443,37.009098],[-76.3727,37.009455],[-76.371332,37.010258],[-76.371094,37.009247],[-76.370975,37.008266],[-76.370826,37.006689],[-76.36925,37.006838],[-76.368268,37.007016],[-76.366632,37.007195],[-76.365226,37.007308]]]]},"properties":{"name":null,"holc_id":"A4","holc_grade":"A","area_description_data":{"2":"60% 40","3":"200 singles, $3,500-6,500 well","5":"4","6":"FHA","8":"This is a level area approximately 60% developed.

Since the security area map was limited in size, only Rivermont and a section of Hilton are shown on the map. Hilton Village was developed during the World War by the U.S. Housing Corportation and was later sold in one trade to the Newport News Shipbuilding and Dry Dock Company who subsequently marketed this group of about 200 small homes, to individual owners. This particular group of homes in Hilton Village would probably now fall in the $3,500-$4,500 class and while because of age they would not classify as first grade, they have been beneficially influenced by good maintenance, pride of ownership, and character of the surrounding developments. THe newer construction is sound, well-planned, and has attracted a good middle and upper middle class of people. Morrison is also an established community. Other developments mentioned are of more recent origin. The construction is sound, well planned and attractive. The terrain is slightly rolling in some places but generally level. Brick and frame houses are well spaced and some are on very large lots. There is no important concentration of new houses in one place but construction is preceding slowly throughout the area and it is attracting the executives and business men of Newport News. On the whole this is an area occupied by people in a higher income group than those now being attracted to the Wythe and Indian River Section of Elizabeth City County (Area A-4).","9":"Warwick County 1st A-5 Jan. 1940","71":"9","72":"$26.50","1a":"Yes N/A N/A","1b":"Executives - business men - professional - clerks","1c":"0% N/A","1d":"0%","1e":"none","2a":"1 family, 5-7 rooms N/A","2b":"2 story brick and frame N/A","2c":"8 years N/A","2d":"good N/A","2e":"95% N/A","2f":"85% N/A","2g":"4500 to 10000 N/A","2h":"4750 to 10000 0.02 N/A N/A","2i":"1939 5000 to 10000 0.02 N/A N/A","2j":"good N/A","2k":"firm N/A","2l":"35 to 80 N/A","2m":"40 to 85 0.09 N/A N/A","2n":"1939 45 to 85 0.04 N/A N/A","2o":"good N/A","2p":"firm N/A","4a":"0","4b":"N/A","5a":"3 - $10,600","5b":"N/A"}}},{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"MultiPolygon","coordinates":[[[[-76.251017,36.94568],[-76.251395,36.945341],[-76.252622,36.945903],[-76.254209,36.946161],[-76.257052,36.946549],[-76.258053,36.946626],[-76.256746,36.947671],[-76.255855,36.948472],[-76.25532,36.948953],[-76.254183,36.949959],[-76.252884,36.950947],[-76.252605,36.951536],[-76.251115,36.952052],[-76.249613,36.951103],[-76.246837,36.949279],[-76.251017,36.94568]]]]},"properties":{"name":null,"holc_id":"B1","holc_grade":"B","area_description_data":{"2":"100% N/A","3":"10 1-family, $5,000-8,000 slow","5":"4","6":"ample","8":"This is a level area approximately 25% developed.

A small part of this area is subject to a special assessment which has been agreed upon in consideration of street improvements, but it will expire in 1942.","9":"West Ghent (Norfolk) 2nd B-11 Dec. 1939","71":"9","72":"$25.00","1a":"N/A N/A Yes","1b":"Business men - some executives and professional, $4,000-10,000","1c":"25% Jewish","1d":"0%","1e":"Jewish, slowly","2a":"1-family 2 story, 6-8 rooms N/A","2b":"frame - brick N/A","2c":"17 years N/A","2d":"good N/A","2e":"97% N/A","2f":"85% N/A","2g":"5000 to 10000 N/A","2h":"5000 to 10000 0% N/A N/A","2i":"1939 6000 to 11000 0.13 N/A N/A","2j":"fair N/A","2k":"firm N/A","2l":"40 to 75 N/A","2m":"45 to 80 0.09 N/A N/A","2n":"1939 50 to 85 0.08 N/A N/A","2o":"good N/A","2p":"firm N/A","4a":"4 - $45,300","4b":"10","5a":"4 - $23,100","5b":"2"}}},{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"MultiPolygon","coordinates":[[[[-76.295678,36.868519],[-76.293181,36.867342],[-76.293384,36.866737],[-76.294376,36.864303],[-76.29516,36.862943],[-76.296095,36.861319],[-76.296095,36.861319],[-76.297498,36.858771],[-76.2963,36.858178],[-76.296813,36.857128],[-76.297526,36.856111],[-76.298125,36.855257],[-76.298696,36.855451],[-76.299095,36.855667],[-76.299309,36.855861],[-76.299348,36.855887],[-76.299694,36.856112],[-76.299865,36.856329],[-76.299936,36.856751],[-76.299822,36.857139],[-76.299779,36.857379],[-76.299623,36.857733],[-76.299423,36.858075],[-76.299411,36.858096],[-76.299266,36.85836],[-76.299066,36.85868],[-76.298781,36.85909],[-76.29871,36.859296],[-76.298626,36.859435],[-76.298525,36.859604],[-76.299551,36.859878],[-76.299494,36.860003],[-76.297526,36.862885],[-76.296294,36.864863],[-76.297954,36.865526],[-76.298376,36.865697],[-76.297089,36.867651],[-76.296326,36.867394],[-76.295678,36.868519]]]]},"properties":{"name":null,"holc_id":"B12","holc_grade":"B","area_description_data":{"2":"90% 10%","3":"0 N/A N/A","5":"4","6":"ample","8":"An established neighborhood approximately 95% developed with fairly large houses of sound construction and attractively landscaped.

It is fairly well developed in its eastern portion around Hampton Blvd., which is a thoroughfare to the Naval Operating Base and the Newport News ferry. The extreme western portion is now sparsely settled, although there are a number of large old houses and estates along the water front. Transportation is available by street car and bus approximately 20 minutes to down town Norfolk. Schools, churches and neighborhood stores are convenient. Existing construction is sound and the population is stable. Practically all of the water front, which borders three sides of the area, is desirable. Streets are hard surfaced but poorly lighted, which is a common fault with all Norfolk neighborhoods. There is a U.S. Government hospital at the northern end of Hampton Blvd. and at the southern boundary there is a new apartment group containing 172 units and renting for approximately $15.00 per room per month, although some units are rented furnished at a higher figure. The Norfolk branch of William and Mary College is near by and an athletic stadium known as Foreman Field is adjacent. Certain parts of the area are subject to a special assessment which has been agreed upon in consideration of street improvements, and will expire in 1944. Although a few new houses are being built in various parts of the area; it has generally reached the peak of its desirability and due to general age and obsolescence is not worthy of the highest grade.","9":"Larchmont (Norfolk) 2nd B-6 Dec. 1939","71":"9","72":"$25.00","1a":"N/A N/A Yes","1b":"Business and professional, $3,000-6,000","1c":"0% N/A","1d":"0%","1e":"None","2a":"1-family, 6-8

N/A","3":"65 Bungalows, $5,000-7,000 Moderately","5":"4","6":"ample","8":"The portion of this area known as Belvedere lies south of Afton St. and is 100% built up. The upper portion, about 40% built up, is known as Ellsworth and Cromwell. While Belvedere has a very desirable appearance, it is unworthy of the best classification for the reason that most of the houses have been built with very low foundations with insufficient ventilation to dry out foundation timbers, which gives rise to possible difficulties from dampness and termites. The resulting sales resistance has caused the developers to offer the houses either for sale or for rent furnished or unfurnished and this has attracted such people as those temporarily attached to the Naval Operating Base and other transient families, so that the population is comparatively unstable. A somewhat better class of construction prevails in Cromwell and Ellsworth. The development is well planned, parklike in appearance and attractively landscaped. Most streets are winding and there are few sidewalks. The streets are poorly lighted, a fault common in all Norfolk neighborhoods. No sewers have been installed, but the area has all other city facilities. Lots are ample in size, many being 75 by 150 feet, and the waterfront sites are the most desirable. Schools, churches and neighborhood stores are convenient, and 20 minute transportation to downtown Norfolk is available on Granby Street.","9":"Belvedere (Norfolk) 2nd B-7 Dec. 1939","71":"9","72":"$25.00","1a":"Slowly N/A N/A","1b":"White collar - business men - Navy personnel, $2,000-4,000","1c":"0% N/A","1d":"0%","1e":"None","2a":"1-family, 5-6 rooms N/A","2b":"Frame N/A","2c":"2 years N/A","2d":"Good N/A","2e":"98% N/A","2f":"50% N/A","2g":"none built N/A","2h":"5000 to 7000 - N/A N/A","2i":"1939 5000 to 7000 0% N/A N/A","2j":"fair N/A","2k":"firm N/A","2l":"none N/A","2m":"50 to 65 0% N/A N/A","2n":"1939 50 to 65 0% N/A N/A","2o":"N/A N/A","2p":"N/A N/A","4a":"0","4b":"0","5a":"1 - $4,300","5b":"0"}}},{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"MultiPolygon","coordinates":[[[[-76.27155,36.886229],[-76.271669,36.886362],[-76.271692,36.886818],[-76.27193,36.886989],[-76.27231,36.88697],[-76.272572,36.886685],[-76.272596,36.886438],[-76.272905,36.886381],[-76.273095,36.886153],[-76.273071,36.885906],[-76.273427,36.885887],[-76.273832,36.885944],[-76.274141,36.88583],[-76.27445,36.885811],[-76.274901,36.885963],[-76.27502,36.886248],[-76.27521,36.886628],[-76.275139,36.88678],[-76.274545,36.886875],[-76.274069,36.886951],[-76.273808,36.887084],[-76.273808,36.887312],[-76.273309,36.88754],[-76.272952,36.887693],[-76.272619,36.887674],[-76.272263,36.887731],[-76.272168,36.887883],[-76.272453,36.887978],[-76.272738,36.888016],[-76.273309,36.888016],[-76.273594,36.887845],[-76.274141,36.887731],[-76.274426,36.88794],[-76.274735,36.888339],[-76.274592,36.888852],[-76.274212,36.889061],[-76.273736,36.889194],[-76.273427,36.889194],[-76.273,36.889232],[-76.272857,36.889327],[-76.272928,36.889517],[-76.272239,36.889536],[-76.272239,36.889803],[-76.272405,36.890069],[-76.272691,36.890354],[-76.272905,36.890449],[-76.273,36.890639],[-76.272857,36.890943],[-76.272501,36.891019],[-76.272073,36.891019],[-76.271764,36.890943],[-76.271265,36.890848],[-76.27067,36.890829],[-76.270409,36.890886],[-76.270171,36.891038],[-76.270124,36.891285],[-76.27029,36.891399],[-76.270599,36.891494],[-76.270623,36.891608],[-76.270338,36.891704],[-76.270171,36.891627],[-76.269981,36.891704],[-76.270005,36.891818],[-76.270171,36.891856],[-76.27048,36.891894],[-76.27048,36.892027],[-76.27048,36.892369],[-76.270575,36.892502],[-76.270813,36.89254],[-76.271051,36.89235],[-76.271265,36.892293],[-76.271336,36.89216],[-76.271597,36.892274],[-76.271455,36.892578],[-76.271455,36.892806],[-76.271645,36.892654],[-76.27174,36.892616],[-76.271906,36.892768],[-76.271906,36.893167],[-76.271883,36.893433],[-76.271978,36.893737],[-76.272239,36.893928],[-76.27231,36.894213],[-76.272215,36.89446],[-76.272025,36.89465],[-76.271764,36.894498],[-76.271526,36.894346],[-76.271241,36.894194],[-76.271003,36.894061],[-76.270789,36.894023],[-76.270623,36.894118],[-76.270314,36.894365],[-76.270195,36.894631],[-76.270124,36.894897],[-76.270124,36.89503],[-76.269981,36.895201],[-76.26972,36.895353],[-76.269648,36.895581],[-76.269767,36.895866],[-76.26971,36.896043],[-76.26952,36.896129],[-76.269342,36.896138],[-76.269152,36.896376],[-76.268985,36.896528],[-76.268759,36.89667],[-76.268557,36.896594],[-76.268296,36.89648],[-76.268165,36.896347],[-76.268141,36.896167],[-76.26826,36.895986],[-76.268308,36.895872],[-76.268308,36.89571],[-76.268225,36.895558],[-76.268058,36.895539],[-76.267904,36.895596],[-76.26763,36.895682],[-76.267405,36.895644],[-76.267452,36.895473],[-76.267595,36.895321],[-76.267726,36.895169],[-76.267809,36.89495],[-76.267892,36.894665],[-76.267928,36.894351],[-76.267999,36.894104],[-76.267999,36.893981],[-76.267761,36.893914],[-76.267595,36.89381],[-76.267535,36.893648],[-76.267642,36.893487],[-76.267785,36.893382],[-76.267642,36.893325],[-76.26744,36.893315],[-76.267321,36.89322],[-76.267345,36.893011],[-76.2675,36.892907],[-76.267547,36.892736],[-76.267452,36.892584],[-76.267345,36.89247],[-76.267286,36.892308],[-76.267381,36.892089],[-76.26744,36.891956],[-76.267524,36.891728],[-76.267829,36.891101],[-76.268042,36.891067],[-76.268199,36.891124],[-76.268984,36.891261],[-76.269469,36.891352],[-76.26964,36.891226],[-76.269868,36.890941],[-76.270182,36.890679],[-76.27041,36.890382],[-76.270668,36.890001],[-76.27081,36.889811],[-76.270877,36.889537],[-76.270924,36.889263],[-76.270991,36.888929],[-76.270991,36.888701],[-76.271,36.888397],[-76.270991,36.888039],[-76.270877,36.887727],[-76.270829,36.887385],[-76.27081,36.887104],[-76.27081,36.886823],[-76.270896,36.886511],[-76.271048,36.886366],[-76.271333,36.886229],[-76.27155,36.886229]]]]},"properties":{"name":null,"holc_id":"B8","holc_grade":"B","area_description_data":{"2":"100% N/A","3":"4 1-family, $11,000 Built to order","5":"4","6":"Ample","8":"A level area approximately 40% built up with high class residences of substantial construction on good sized lots.

There is a good outlook to the north from Mayflower Rd., which is landscaped and desirable. Houses are well spaced and of sound construction.

Streets are hard surfaced and have sidewalks but are poorly lighted, a fault common with all Norfolk neighborhoods. There is little through traffic. Schools and churches are convenient and neighborhood stores are reasonably near. Fifteen minutes transportation to downtown Norfolk is afforded by bus. Much of the northern end of this area is filled in land and inclined to be damp and requiring the installation of piling prior to construction to assure sound foundations. At times when a high tide is attended with a strong northeast wind, the water overflows Mayflower Rd. The waterfront to the west is undesirable, being muddy and unsightly at low tide. Also the outlook to Area C-8 is poor. An orphanage is located on Massachusetts Ave. near Gosnold, and there is a large nursing home on Gosnold Avenue. These inflluences cause sales resistance and have resulted in a declining level of market prices since 1935. General residential desirability is therefore adversely affected and the area is worthy of only a moderately good grade.","9":"Colonial Place (Norfolk) Low 2nd B-9 Dec. 1939","71":"9","72":"$25.00","1a":"N/A N/A Yes","1b":"Business men - Jr. executives, $2,500-5,000","1c":"0% N/A","1d":"0%","1e":"none","2a":"1-family 2 story, 6-7 rooms N/A","2b":"frame - brick N/A","2c":"15 years N/A","2d":"fair - good N/A","2e":"98% N/A","2f":"90% N/A","2g":"6000 to 10000 N/A","2h":"5500 to 9500 -6% N/A N/A","2i":"1939 5000 to 9000 -6% N/A N/A","2j":"poor N/A","2k":"static N/A","2l":"45 to 60 N/A","2m":"45 to 60 0% N/A N/A","2n":"1939 45 to 60 0% N/A N/A","2o":"fair N/A","2p":"firm N/A","4a":"2 - $15,600","4b":"10","5a":"2 - $13,900","5b":"10"}}},{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"MultiPolygon","coordinates":[[[[-76.291535,36.967793],[-76.290529,36.967716],[-76.289399,36.967682],[-76.288384,36.967689],[-76.287457,36.967689],[-76.287085,36.96771],[-76.286622,36.967719],[-76.285028,36.967844],[-76.284034,36.967917],[-76.282822,36.968031],[-76.282266,36.96806],[-76.281753,36.968088],[-76.280618,36.968015],[-76.279598,36.967898],[-76.278033,36.967682],[-76.276607,36.967374],[-76.275352,36.966958],[-76.274094,36.966505],[-76.272963,36.966101],[-76.272069,36.965779],[-76.270642,36.965066],[-76.269145,36.9644],[-76.2684,36.964118],[-76.267387,36.963654],[-76.266664,36.963292],[-76.265765,36.962665],[-76.264414,36.961965],[-76.263416,36.961196],[-76.261947,36.960378],[-76.260721,36.959606],[-76.259423,36.958959],[-76.260984,36.957323],[-76.26348,36.95505],[-76.264383,36.955642],[-76.264122,36.955984],[-76.263789,36.956725],[-76.263932,36.956981],[-76.263884,36.958092],[-76.264027,36.958596],[-76.264263,36.958907],[-76.265072,36.959137],[-76.266178,36.959811],[-76.266784,36.960628],[-76.267283,36.961207],[-76.267627,36.961676],[-76.268021,36.961894],[-76.268622,36.961968],[-76.26922,36.961872],[-76.26996,36.961666],[-76.27059,36.961729],[-76.271466,36.961929],[-76.271672,36.962213],[-76.272013,36.962593],[-76.272322,36.962945],[-76.272643,36.963125],[-76.273213,36.962964],[-76.274224,36.96263],[-76.274972,36.962555],[-76.275673,36.962612],[-76.276634,36.962943],[-76.278403,36.963535],[-76.279316,36.963717],[-76.280399,36.963717],[-76.282168,36.963809],[-76.283309,36.963854],[-76.284709,36.963809],[-76.284735,36.963809],[-76.286218,36.963626],[-76.287187,36.963125],[-76.288728,36.962669],[-76.289022,36.962575],[-76.289583,36.962396],[-76.290197,36.962557],[-76.290673,36.962815],[-76.291471,36.963013],[-76.292023,36.963393],[-76.292327,36.963879],[-76.292631,36.964015],[-76.292916,36.963833],[-76.293164,36.963833],[-76.293449,36.964091],[-76.293943,36.964015],[-76.294342,36.964183],[-76.294628,36.964502],[-76.294951,36.964729],[-76.295326,36.965068],[-76.295778,36.965276],[-76.296206,36.965485],[-76.296396,36.965542],[-76.296705,36.965542],[-76.297014,36.965333],[-76.297275,36.964973],[-76.297299,36.964669],[-76.297466,36.96427],[-76.297703,36.963909],[-76.297694,36.963609],[-76.297917,36.963225],[-76.298107,36.962865],[-76.298367,36.962618],[-76.298621,36.963192],[-76.29855,36.964027],[-76.298224,36.96484],[-76.298081,36.965752],[-76.297796,36.966378],[-76.297368,36.967347],[-76.297321,36.967881],[-76.297012,36.968429],[-76.296287,36.968593],[-76.295443,36.968657],[-76.295163,36.968546],[-76.294445,36.968258],[-76.293518,36.968031],[-76.292793,36.967947],[-76.291916,36.967833],[-76.291535,36.967793]]]]},"properties":{"name":null,"holc_id":"C1","holc_grade":"C","area_description_data":{"2":"95% N/A","3":"12 bungalows, $3,500-4,000 fair - some built to rent","5":"4","6":"limited","8":"This is a long narrow strip of land at the northern extremity of Norfolk, approximately 50% built up.

Few streets other than the principal thoroughfare are paved and all are poorly lighted, a fault common with all Norfolk neighborhoods. Many of the structures on Ocean View Ave. are small hotels and summer boarding houses. The terrain is higher toward the western end but at the narrowest point toward the east it is low and flooded at times with high tide is accompanied by a strong northeast wind, thus entirely cutting off the section until ebb tide.

However it lies in the eastern section of Norfolk and away from the line of growth, which is north and west. This results in sales resistance and therefore both sales prices and rents have declined. No bus transportation is available, although there is a street car line on Lafeyette Blvd. about 15 minutes to downtown Norfolk. It is several miles to high school, but grade schools are convenient.

The only other entrance directly from Norfolk is 26th St. which becomes Lafayette Blvd. Estimated occupancy of units in Winona is 75% and although this part of the area contains some pretentious houses, especially along the waterfront, there is little demand for these.","9":"Winona and Lafeyette Residence Park High 3rd C-11 Nov. 1939","71":"9","72":"$25.00","1a":"N/A N/A Yes","1b":"Business people - white collar - clerks - merchants, $2,500","1c":"0% N/A","1d":"0%","1e":"none","2a":"1-family 2 story, 6-7 rooms Bungalows, 5 rooms","2b":"frame - few brick frame","2c":"30 years 25 years","2d":"fair - good fair - good","2e":"90% 95%","2f":"60% 75%","2g":"3000 to 7000 2500 to 4000","2h":"2750 to 6750 -5% 2250 to 3750 -8%","2i":"1939 2500 to 6500 -5% 2250 to 3500 -4%","2j":"poor poor","2k":"weak weak","2l":"25 to 60 20 to 35","2m":"25 to 50 -12% 20 to 32.5 -5%","2n":"1939 25 to 50 0% 20 to 32.5 0%","2o":"Poor in Winona, Fair in Lafeyette fair","2p":"firm firm","4a":"10 - $71,000","4b":"50","5a":"7 - $34,800","5b":"25"}}},{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"MultiPolygon","coordinates":[[[[-76.256181,36.881391],[-76.252673,36.877489],[-76.252393,36.877648],[-76.252257,36.877084],[-76.251886,36.875547],[-76.248482,36.861815],[-76.255442,36.858138],[-76.25589,36.858355],[-76.256241,36.858879],[-76.256013,36.859382],[-76.256013,36.859937],[-76.256251,36.860066],[-76.256393,36.860576],[-76.256526,36.861105],[-76.256688,36.861641],[-76.256146,36.861854],[-76.255813,36.861571],[-76.255385,36.861425],[-76.254986,36.861059],[-76.254472,36.860831],[-76.254464,36.860941],[-76.254825,36.861131],[-76.255081,36.861481],[-76.255043,36.861816],[-76.255509,36.861884],[-76.256298,36.862109],[-76.25684,36.862439],[-76.257495,36.863022],[-76.258152,36.863542],[-76.258636,36.864072],[-76.258476,36.864508],[-76.258067,36.864714],[-76.257553,36.864759],[-76.257096,36.864619],[-76.25664,36.86452],[-76.256129,36.86455],[-76.256156,36.864881],[-76.255613,36.864939],[-76.255442,36.864711],[-76.254871,36.864528],[-76.254664,36.864451],[-76.25415,36.864409],[-76.253731,36.864437],[-76.253331,36.864208],[-76.252724,36.864014],[-76.252413,36.864045],[-76.252695,36.864265],[-76.253152,36.86466],[-76.253722,36.864767],[-76.254415,36.864939],[-76.254882,36.865178],[-76.255188,36.865557],[-76.255496,36.865592],[-76.256036,36.865383],[-76.256276,36.865304],[-76.257154,36.86501],[-76.257715,36.865033],[-76.258009,36.86503],[-76.258827,36.864873],[-76.259378,36.86503],[-76.259815,36.865266],[-76.259864,36.865459],[-76.259721,36.865923],[-76.259549,36.866399],[-76.259207,36.866855],[-76.259123,36.867223],[-76.258713,36.867718],[-76.258704,36.867931],[-76.258894,36.867908],[-76.259141,36.867634],[-76.259493,36.867087],[-76.259777,36.866627],[-76.260062,36.866217],[-76.260462,36.865806],[-76.2611,36.865497],[-76.261661,36.865508],[-76.261682,36.865503],[-76.262393,36.865239],[-76.262801,36.865839],[-76.263125,36.866463],[-76.263324,36.866889],[-76.263467,36.867064],[-76.263866,36.867345],[-76.264123,36.867368],[-76.264532,36.867277],[-76.265025,36.867548],[-76.265093,36.868159],[-76.265102,36.868707],[-76.265159,36.868829],[-76.265283,36.868669],[-76.265482,36.868179],[-76.265767,36.867859],[-76.266309,36.867703],[-76.26648,36.867768],[-76.266861,36.867931],[-76.266965,36.868407],[-76.266925,36.868724],[-76.266908,36.868863],[-76.266793,36.86932],[-76.266918,36.869718],[-76.267193,36.869867],[-76.267469,36.86962],[-76.267523,36.869303],[-76.267612,36.868887],[-76.267802,36.86838],[-76.268116,36.868349],[-76.268392,36.868616],[-76.268515,36.869011],[-76.268449,36.869627],[-76.268715,36.869893],[-76.269285,36.870304],[-76.269837,36.870669],[-76.270303,36.87089],[-76.270797,36.871148],[-76.271015,36.87151],[-76.271471,36.872469],[-76.271585,36.872925],[-76.271826,36.873043],[-76.271467,36.873033],[-76.271305,36.873017],[-76.271181,36.873005],[-76.27091,36.873012],[-76.270575,36.873047],[-76.270161,36.873133],[-76.269882,36.873283],[-76.269597,36.873504],[-76.269497,36.873619],[-76.269404,36.873762],[-76.269347,36.87382],[-76.269266,36.873849],[-76.269167,36.873857],[-76.268804,36.873786],[-76.268439,36.873714],[-76.268057,36.873636],[-76.267679,36.873547],[-76.267318,36.873459],[-76.266962,36.873372],[-76.266515,36.873281],[-76.266068,36.873242],[-76.265906,36.873322],[-76.265783,36.873406],[-76.26564,36.873653],[-76.263901,36.87779],[-76.26358,36.878526],[-76.263318,36.879126],[-76.262484,36.878904],[-76.260041,36.878265],[-76.258595,36.881853],[-76.257902,36.881938],[-76.256799,36.88206],[-76.256181,36.881391]]]]},"properties":{"name":null,"holc_id":"C12","holc_grade":"C","area_description_data":{"2":"75% 25%","3":"30 bungalows, $3,250-4,000 moderately","5":"4","6":"ample FHA","8":"This area appeals to people of moderate income and the population is stable, with good pride of home ownership on many of the streets. Lafayette Blvd. and Ballentine Blvd. are principal thoroughfares but there is little traffic through the area otherwise. There is a large playground in the area, adjacent to the schoolhouse. Churches, a theatre and neighborhood stores are convenient. A majority of the area has all city facilities, most of which were installed during the past year. Transportation affords 25 minute service to Norfolk by both bus and street car. The area is located at the extreme eastern edge of Norfolk City and not in line with the city's growth. Only about half of the streets are hard surfaced and have sidewalks, and all are poorly lighted, a fault common with all Norfolk neighborhoods. These adverse features, coupled with advancing age and obsolescence, indicate that as a whole, the area is definitely declining in desirability.","9":"Ballentine Place and Lafayette Annex (Norfolk) 3rd C-12 Dec. 1939","71":"9","72":"$25.00","1a":"Slowly N/A N/A","1b":"Skilled mechanics - Navy people - merchants - clerks, $2,000","1c":"0% N/A","1d":"0%","1e":"none","2a":"Bungalows, 5-6 rooms 1-family 2 story, 6-7 rooms","2b":"frame frame","2c":"15 years 15 years","2d":"fair - good fair","2e":"97% 97%","2f":"70% 50%","2g":"1800 to 3500 2250 to 4500","2h":"2000 to 3750 0.08 2250 to 4250 -4%","2i":"1939 2000 to 4000 0.04 2250 to 4250 0%","2j":"fair fair","2k":"firm firm","2l":"20 to 35 25 to 40","2m":"20 to 35 0% 25 to 40 0%","2n":"1939 25 to 37.5 0.14 25 to 40 0%","2o":"good fair","2p":"upward firm","4a":"8 - $25,000","4b":"20","5a":"22 - $65,200","5b":"50"}}},{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"MultiPolygon","coordinates":[[[[-76.307029,36.867344],[-76.306743,36.867207],[-76.306363,36.867253],[-76.306515,36.867055],[-76.306097,36.866721],[-76.305179,36.866252],[-76.305263,36.866129],[-76.305714,36.865474],[-76.305882,36.865231],[-76.306682,36.864068],[-76.307205,36.863497],[-76.311932,36.865685],[-76.310556,36.867909],[-76.309196,36.868208],[-76.308106,36.868507],[-76.307975,36.868346],[-76.307903,36.868257],[-76.307637,36.867846],[-76.307403,36.867558],[-76.30739,36.867542],[-76.307383,36.867539],[-76.307029,36.867344]]]]},"properties":{"name":null,"holc_id":"C13","holc_grade":"C","area_description_data":{"2":"90% N/A","3":"0 N/A N/A","5":"4","6":"limited","8":"A very sparsely settled level area, approximately 20% built up.

There is also some industry adjacent to the south and west, including a lumber yard and the Norfolk Sash Company.","9":"Part of West Ghent (Norfolk) Low 3rd C-13 Nov. 1939","71":"9","72":"$25.00","1a":"N/A N/A Yes","1b":"Railroad and dock labor - mechanics, $1,200-1,800","1c":"0% N/A","1d":"0%","1e":"none","2a":"1-family 2 story, 6 rooms N/A","2b":"frame - brick N/A","2c":"25 years N/A","2d":"fair N/A","2e":"97% N/A","2f":"35% N/A","2g":"2500 to 4000 N/A","2h":"2500 to 4000 0% N/A N/A","2i":"1939 2500 to 4000 0% N/A N/A","2j":"fair N/A","2k":"firm N/A","2l":"20 to 35 N/A","2m":"20 to 35 0% N/A N/A","2n":"1939 25 to 40 0.08 N/A N/A","2o":"good N/A","2p":"firm N/A","4a":"2 - $12,000","4b":"5","5a":"1 - $2,800","5b":"6"}}},{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"MultiPolygon","coordinates":[[[[-76.304442,36.873803],[-76.303941,36.873601],[-76.303667,36.873495],[-76.303443,36.873431],[-76.30322,36.873359],[-76.302878,36.873267],[-76.302279,36.873104],[-76.301817,36.873027],[-76.301559,36.872933],[-76.301456,36.872898],[-76.301271,36.872834],[-76.300848,36.872644],[-76.300596,36.872518],[-76.30023,36.872396],[-76.299916,36.872286],[-76.299745,36.872206],[-76.29956,36.87213],[-76.299341,36.871971],[-76.299178,36.871824],[-76.29906,36.871632],[-76.298853,36.871558],[-76.298586,36.871484],[-76.298335,36.871454],[-76.298039,36.871336],[-76.297796,36.871218],[-76.297448,36.871188],[-76.297192,36.871065],[-76.297083,36.870955],[-76.296917,36.870757],[-76.296631,36.870571],[-76.29638,36.870396],[-76.296037,36.870195],[-76.295833,36.870088],[-76.295481,36.869951],[-76.295051,36.869842],[-76.294597,36.869681],[-76.294207,36.869582],[-76.293912,36.869495],[-76.293705,36.869398],[-76.293365,36.86925],[-76.293143,36.869162],[-76.292892,36.869058],[-76.292458,36.868906],[-76.293162,36.867397],[-76.293181,36.867342],[-76.295678,36.868519],[-76.296326,36.867394],[-76.297089,36.867651],[-76.298376,36.865697],[-76.297954,36.865526],[-76.296294,36.864863],[-76.297526,36.862885],[-76.299494,36.860003],[-76.299551,36.859878],[-76.298525,36.859604],[-76.298626,36.859435],[-76.298897,36.859399],[-76.299104,36.859325],[-76.299341,36.859192],[-76.299533,36.859029],[-76.299725,36.858911],[-76.299903,36.858808],[-76.300051,36.85866],[-76.300213,36.858541],[-76.300435,36.858364],[-76.300568,36.858216],[-76.300746,36.858068],[-76.300894,36.857994],[-76.301116,36.858024],[-76.301393,36.858073],[-76.301435,36.85809],[-76.302558,36.858548],[-76.30175,36.859804],[-76.303176,36.860412],[-76.302249,36.861743],[-76.304935,36.863131],[-76.306682,36.864068],[-76.305882,36.865231],[-76.305714,36.865474],[-76.305263,36.866129],[-76.305179,36.866252],[-76.304728,36.866021],[-76.304498,36.866291],[-76.304158,36.86669],[-76.304015,36.86688],[-76.303815,36.867147],[-76.303872,36.867497],[-76.303587,36.867542],[-76.303549,36.867725],[-76.303321,36.868014],[-76.303093,36.86809],[-76.303013,36.868068],[-76.302712,36.867983],[-76.302484,36.867801],[-76.302256,36.86775],[-76.302142,36.867725],[-76.301952,36.867877],[-76.301743,36.868211],[-76.301572,36.868485],[-76.301592,36.868509],[-76.301743,36.868683],[-76.301781,36.868835],[-76.301762,36.8692],[-76.301819,36.869641],[-76.301911,36.869966],[-76.302047,36.870448],[-76.302083,36.870783],[-76.302189,36.871239],[-76.302246,36.871384],[-76.302368,36.871696],[-76.302566,36.872061],[-76.302655,36.872227],[-76.302876,36.872326],[-76.303346,36.872537],[-76.303805,36.872742],[-76.304443,36.873063],[-76.304733,36.873221],[-76.305076,36.873325],[-76.305661,36.873513],[-76.306078,36.873602],[-76.306207,36.873188],[-76.306416,36.872407],[-76.306702,36.872521],[-76.307065,36.872612],[-76.307293,36.872623],[-76.307643,36.872629],[-76.307878,36.8726],[-76.308193,36.872573],[-76.308463,36.872538],[-76.308677,36.872429],[-76.308866,36.872334],[-76.308649,36.871818],[-76.307337,36.868735],[-76.308106,36.868507],[-76.309196,36.868208],[-76.310556,36.867909],[-76.311517,36.871936],[-76.31092,36.872144],[-76.309908,36.872492],[-76.309323,36.87268],[-76.30943,36.872823],[-76.309487,36.872874],[-76.309573,36.87292],[-76.309701,36.872977],[-76.309886,36.873085],[-76.310093,36.873205],[-76.310307,36.873422],[-76.310378,36.873661],[-76.310301,36.873865],[-76.310115,36.873986],[-76.309915,36.873998],[-76.309701,36.873998],[-76.309587,36.874043],[-76.309651,36.874163],[-76.309632,36.874282],[-76.309523,36.87437],[-76.309314,36.874461],[-76.308981,36.874632],[-76.308644,36.874781],[-76.308392,36.874804],[-76.308092,36.874849],[-76.307821,36.874868],[-76.307503,36.874876],[-76.307239,36.874856],[-76.307017,36.874782],[-76.306766,36.874679],[-76.306515,36.874501],[-76.306322,36.874294],[-76.306034,36.874146],[-76.305697,36.874089],[-76.305283,36.874043],[-76.304903,36.873944],[-76.304442,36.873803]]]]},"properties":{"name":null,"holc_id":"C14","holc_grade":"C","area_description_data":{"2":"40% 30%","3":"0 N/A N/A","5":"4","6":"limited","8":"South of Princess Anne Road this area constitutes one of the older residential sections of Norfolk.

Streets other than thoroughfares are only in fair condition, but all streets are poorly lighted.","9":"Ocean View (Norfolk) Low 3rd C-2 Dec. 1939","71":"9","72":"$25.00","1a":"Slowly N/A N/A","1b":"White collar, Navy people, $1,000-1,500","1c":"0% N/A","1d":"0%","1e":"none","2a":"1-family 2 story, 5-6 rooms bungalows, 4-5 rooms","2b":"frame frame","2c":"18 years 14 years","2d":"fair fair","2e":"85% 85%","2f":"60% 60%","2g":"2500 to 4500 1500 to 2500","2h":"2750 to 4750 0.07 1750 to 2750 0.13","2i":"1939 3000 to 5000 0.07 1750 to 3000 0.06","2j":"fair fair","2k":"up slowly firm","2l":"30 to 40 20 to 25","2m":"30 to 40 0% 20 to 25 0%","2n":"1939 30 to 40 0% 20 to 25 0%","2o":"fair (good in summer) fair","2p":"firm firm","4a":"0","4b":"10","5a":"2 - $6,000","5b":"25"}}},{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"MultiPolygon","coordinates":[[[[-76.25283,36.828632],[-76.253859,36.829035],[-76.254083,36.829112],[-76.254958,36.829415],[-76.255077,36.829605],[-76.255464,36.829986],[-76.256028,36.830152],[-76.256533,36.830485],[-76.257157,36.830675],[-76.25738,36.830996],[-76.257454,36.831103],[-76.257306,36.831508],[-76.25689,36.831793],[-76.256605,36.831846],[-76.256503,36.831864],[-76.256266,36.832126],[-76.256206,36.832792],[-76.254103,36.836237],[-76.25361,36.836534],[-76.252668,36.836782],[-76.252252,36.836893],[-76.251718,36.8369],[-76.250339,36.836729],[-76.249629,36.83661],[-76.248669,36.83588],[-76.248692,36.835378],[-76.250168,36.833236],[-76.251955,36.830009],[-76.25283,36.828632]]]]},"properties":{"name":null,"holc_id":"C20","holc_grade":"C","area_description_data":{"2":"75% 25%","3":"3 1-family 2 story, $3,000 built to order","5":"4","6":"ample","8":"This is a level area about 25% built up.

Being a small area of limited possibilities for durther development, adjacent to industry and the gas plant and surrounded by poorer neighborhoods, its only really desirable feature is its location at the water front and its convenience to the downtown business section.","9":"Downtown Portsmouth (Portsmouth, Va.) 3rd C-23 Dec. 1939","71":"9","72":"$25.00","1a":"N/A N/A Yes","1b":"White collar - business men - skilled mechanics - $1,500-2,500","1c":"0% N/A","1d":"0%","1e":"none","2a":"1 family 2 story, 6-8 rooms N/A","2b":"frame, some brick N/A","2c":"35 years N/A","2d":"good N/A","2e":"98% N/A","2f":"35% N/A","2g":"5000 to 7500 N/A","2h":"5000 to 7500 0% N/A N/A","2i":"1939 5000 to 7500 0% N/A N/A","2j":"poor N/A","2k":"static N/A","2l":"40 to 55 N/A","2m":"40 to 55 0% N/A N/A","2n":"1939 40 to 55 0% N/A N/A","2o":"fair N/A","2p":"firm N/A","4a":"0","4b":"5","5a":"1 - $4,300","5b":"2"}}},{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"MultiPolygon","coordinates":[[[[-76.312878,36.819765],[-76.319426,36.818433],[-76.31946,36.819917],[-76.320117,36.819749],[-76.32366,36.819041],[-76.323635,36.819339],[-76.323778,36.819838],[-76.323856,36.819979],[-76.323956,36.820159],[-76.324313,36.820516],[-76.324482,36.820707],[-76.324599,36.820838],[-76.325146,36.821255],[-76.3252,36.822476],[-76.325516,36.828563],[-76.324314,36.828908],[-76.323666,36.829065],[-76.32265,36.829308],[-76.320958,36.829582],[-76.319311,36.829798],[-76.318538,36.829855],[-76.317318,36.829903],[-76.31651,36.829947],[-76.315098,36.830098],[-76.314068,36.830507],[-76.308352,36.829167],[-76.30835,36.829],[-76.308217,36.827097],[-76.30812,36.825166],[-76.312378,36.822645],[-76.312357,36.819878],[-76.312878,36.819765]]]]},"properties":{"name":null,"holc_id":"C24","holc_grade":"C","area_description_data":{"2":"100% N/A","3":"45 Bungalows, $3,000 well","5":"4","6":"FHA","8":"A level area about 60% built up.

Houses are of standard construction and the population is stable, but age and obsolescence as well as the location which is not in line of Norfolk's growth, preclude the classification of the area as desirable in its future trend.","9":"Estabrook (Norfolk County) 3rd C-29 Dec. 1939","71":"9","72":"$20.00","1a":"Slowly N/A N/A","1b":"Clerks - merchants - mechanics, $1,200-2,000","1c":"0% N/A","1d":"0%","1e":"none","2a":"Bungalows & 2-story, 5-6 rooms N/A","2b":"frame N/A","2c":"20 years N/A","2d":"fair N/A","2e":"95% N/A","2f":"60% N/A","2g":"2500 to 4000 N/A","2h":"2500 to 4000 0% N/A N/A","2i":"1939 2500 to 4000 0% N/A N/A","2j":"fair N/A","2k":"firm N/A","2l":"25 to 40 N/A","2m":"25 to 40 0% N/A N/A","2n":"1939 25 to 40 0% N/A N/A","2o":"good N/A","2p":"firm N/A","4a":"0","4b":"5","5a":"6 - $22,500","5b":"15"}}},{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"MultiPolygon","coordinates":[[[[-76.22566,36.939145],[-76.21952,36.937005],[-76.220049,36.935885],[-76.225082,36.937519],[-76.226561,36.93466],[-76.232414,36.936494],[-76.244119,36.935544],[-76.243763,36.933692],[-76.243525,36.933075],[-76.243402,36.931847],[-76.243311,36.930936],[-76.243202,36.929842],[-76.24305,36.928325],[-76.24406,36.927327],[-76.244562,36.927476],[-76.24497,36.92762],[-76.245306,36.927692],[-76.245666,36.927572],[-76.245929,36.927357],[-76.246217,36.927045],[-76.246505,36.926709],[-76.246985,36.926493],[-76.247512,36.926445],[-76.248136,36.926373],[-76.248831,36.926421],[-76.249838,36.926709],[-76.250486,36.926949],[-76.251373,36.927405],[-76.252188,36.927836],[-76.252932,36.928124],[-76.253364,36.928292],[-76.253852,36.928312],[-76.254423,36.933524],[-76.246209,36.93439],[-76.247407,36.944193],[-76.243454,36.947523],[-76.242711,36.948401],[-76.239425,36.946325],[-76.237108,36.944805],[-76.234731,36.943286],[-76.232651,36.942146],[-76.230512,36.941006],[-76.229918,36.940579],[-76.228557,36.940004],[-76.226639,36.93936],[-76.22566,36.939145]]]]},"properties":{"name":null,"holc_id":"C3","holc_grade":"C","area_description_data":{"2":"75% 25%","3":"60 Some 2-family summer bungalows, $2,500 Built to rent or on order","5":"4","6":"limited","8":"A level area approximately 25% built up, although Ocean View Ave. west of Cape View Ave. is well developed.

The homes are generally modest and small, and the population is stable, but age and obsolescence preclude a desirable classification.","9":"Cradock (Portsmouth side) (Norfolk County) 3rd C-33 Oct. 1939","71":"9","72":"$20.00","1a":"slowly N/A N/A","1b":"Navy Yard workers - mechanics - merchants, $1,500-3,000","1c":"0% N/A","1d":"0%","1e":"none","2a":"1-family, 1 & 2 story, 5-8 rooms 2-4 families, 4/5 rooms","2b":"frame (some stucco) frame","2c":"20 years 20 years","2d":"fair to good fair to good","2e":"98% 98%","2f":"75% 40%","2g":"2750 to 3500 3500 to 5000","2h":"3000 to 3750 0.08 3500 to 5000 0%","2i":"1939 3000 to 4000 0.04 3500 to 5000 0%","2j":"good good","2k":"firm firm","2l":"27.5 to 35 20 to 25","2m":"30 to 37.5 0.08 22.5 to 27.5 0.11","2n":"1939 30 to 40 0.04 22.5 to 27.5 0%","2o":"good good","2p":"firm firm","4a":"0","4b":"0","5a":"1 - $2,000","5b":"0"}}},{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"MultiPolygon","coordinates":[[[[-76.32975,36.813849],[-76.329545,36.813812],[-76.328832,36.813812],[-76.328071,36.81385],[-76.327121,36.813774],[-76.32636,36.813926],[-76.325527,36.813926],[-76.325434,36.813926],[-76.325314,36.813926],[-76.325135,36.813878],[-76.32475,36.813776],[-76.324459,36.813698],[-76.32412,36.813583],[-76.323835,36.813486],[-76.323464,36.813361],[-76.323223,36.813279],[-76.32316,36.812132],[-76.322922,36.808987],[-76.329608,36.808981],[-76.333929,36.808776],[-76.334061,36.81012],[-76.334108,36.811034],[-76.334108,36.811681],[-76.333966,36.812442],[-76.333871,36.813089],[-76.333776,36.813774],[-76.333586,36.814307],[-76.333515,36.81481],[-76.332867,36.814602],[-76.33254,36.814497],[-76.332165,36.81438],[-76.33196,36.814315],[-76.331446,36.814154],[-76.331122,36.814096],[-76.330479,36.81398],[-76.32975,36.813849]]]]},"properties":{"name":null,"holc_id":"C34","holc_grade":"C","area_description_data":{"2":"100% N/A","3":"20 1 & 2 story 1 family, $3,000-4,250 moderately","5":"4","6":"limited","8":"A level area approximately 35% built up.

About 10% of the structures are apartment hosues built during the World War and now renting for from $5.00 to $12.00 per room per month. The area bounded by 25th and 35th Streets from Washington to West Street is an older section of Newport News, still inhabited by substantial old families. The large frame and brick houses are closely built and would be difficult to sell, but this part of the area is better than the average. Elsewhere a number of old houses have been converted and are now used as boarding houses for which there is a good rental demand because of the close in location and convenience to employment at the shipyard and railroad terminal. Land values in the area were seriously affected in 1937 when the Old Dominion Land Co. liquidated and exchanged property for outstanding securities.

Residential desirability is declining because of age and obsolescence and the neighborhood lacks charm and appeal.","9":"Elizabeth City County (North East) 3rd C-41 Jan. 1940","71":"9","72":"$23.00","1a":"N/A N/A Yes","1b":"clerks - mechanics - merchants - $1,200-2,500","1c":"0% N/A","1d":"0%","1e":"none","2a":"bungalows - 5 rooms 1 family 2 story, 5-6 rooms","2b":"frame frame","2c":"20 years 25 years","2d":"fair - good fair - good","2e":"98% 98%","2f":"50% 50%","2g":"1250 to 2500 1500 to 3000","2h":"1250 to 2500 0% 1500 to 3000 0%","2i":"1940 1250 to 2500 0% 1500 to 3000 0%","2j":"fair fair","2k":"firm firm","2l":"15 to 22.5 20 to 27.5","2m":"15 to 22.5 0% 20 to 27.5 0%","2n":"1940 15 to 22.5 0% 20 to 27.5 0%","2o":"good good","2p":"firm firm","4a":"0","4b":"5","5a":"0","5b":"2"}}},{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"MultiPolygon","coordinates":[[[[-76.354849,37.025536],[-76.353497,37.025479],[-76.352584,37.025479],[-76.350318,37.025364],[-76.350301,37.022432],[-76.350286,37.019313],[-76.35028,37.018055],[-76.350261,37.017388],[-76.350547,37.017369],[-76.351099,37.017464],[-76.35148,37.017522],[-76.351879,37.017598],[-76.352279,37.01775],[-76.352641,37.01775],[-76.353002,37.017807],[-76.35325,37.018074],[-76.353631,37.018188],[-76.353916,37.018435],[-76.354164,37.01874],[-76.354468,37.019292],[-76.354735,37.019787],[-76.354767,37.01983],[-76.354963,37.020091],[-76.35523,37.020244],[-76.35542,37.02051],[-76.355629,37.020758],[-76.355763,37.021062],[-76.355972,37.021386],[-76.356124,37.021595],[-76.356257,37.021938],[-76.356524,37.022547],[-76.356638,37.02289],[-76.35663,37.023467],[-76.3566,37.025593],[-76.354849,37.025536]]]]},"properties":{"name":null,"holc_id":"C42","holc_grade":"C","area_description_data":{"2":"100% N/A","3":"0 N/A N/A","5":"4","6":"limited","8":"A level area approximately 75% built up.

Here the majority are one-family houses of fair construction and well maintained. Their present market price would range from $2,500 to $5,000 and they are reported to be 80% owner occupied. There is a city dump and an incinerator to the east of Jefferson Ave. at 13th St. Business and industry surround the area. Schools, churches and neighborhood stores are considered convenient and transportation by both bus and street car is adequate. Jefferson Ave. is a principal thoroughfare to the Norfolk ferry and 25th St. to Elizabeth City County and Hampton, and traffic is hazardous.","9":"(South End) Newport News 4th D-27 Dec. 1939","71":"9","72":"$30.50","1a":"N/A N/A Yes","1b":"Domestics - Laborers - R.R. & shipyard workers, $500-1,500","1c":"nil N/A","1d":"95%","1e":"none","2a":"1-family, 4-6 rooms 4-family, 3-room units","2b":"frame frame","2c":"30 years 22 years","2d":"poor very poor","2e":"95% 95%","2f":"30% 10%","2g":"800 to 2000 450 to 1000","2h":"800 to 2000 0% 450 to 1000 0%","2i":"1939 800 to 2000 0% 450 to 1000 0%","2j":"fair poor","2k":"static weak","2l":"10 to 22 6","2m":"10 to 22 0% 6 0%","2n":"1939 10 to 22 0% 6 0%","2o":"good fair","2p":"firm static","4a":"5 - $21,900","4b":"50","5a":"5 - $6,100","5b":"50"}}},{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"MultiPolygon","coordinates":[[[[-76.412118,36.995384],[-76.409233,36.990357],[-76.408103,36.990744],[-76.40962,36.993183],[-76.409357,36.993446],[-76.408668,36.994134],[-76.407805,36.994015],[-76.407002,36.993777],[-76.406295,36.993533],[-76.406229,36.99351],[-76.405396,36.993272],[-76.404652,36.993153],[-76.403879,36.993064],[-76.403195,36.992826],[-76.40266,36.992439],[-76.402655,36.992375],[-76.40263,36.992052],[-76.402451,36.991933],[-76.401886,36.992023],[-76.40199,36.99155],[-76.401999,36.991509],[-76.402368,36.991364],[-76.403156,36.991053],[-76.402413,36.989711],[-76.403984,36.989125],[-76.405058,36.988726],[-76.406438,36.988213],[-76.406795,36.988142],[-76.407866,36.989784],[-76.412898,36.987857],[-76.416182,36.993068],[-76.415182,36.99348],[-76.412118,36.995384]]]]},"properties":{"name":null,"holc_id":"D28","holc_grade":"D","area_description_data":{"2":"100% N/A","3":"0 N/A N/A","5":"4","6":"Limited","8":"This is a level Negro area approximately 80% built up.

Poorly lighted.","9":"Downtown, East Side (Norfolk) 4th D-7 Nov. 1939","71":"9","72":"$25.00","1a":"N/A slowly N/A","1b":"laborers - domestics","1c":"0% N/A","1d":"100%","1e":"none","2a":"1-family mixed types, 5-8 rooms 4-family, 3-4 room rows","2b":"frame brick rows","2c":"40 years 30 years","2d":"poor poor","2e":"90% 90%","2f":"10% 10%","2g":"800 to 1500 1500 to 2500","2h":"800 to 1500 0% 1200 to 2200 -15%","2i":"1939 800 to 1500 0% 1000 to 2000 -12%","2j":"poor poor","2k":"static static","2l":"11 to 16 8 to 12","2m":"10 to 15 -7% 8 to 12 0%","2n":"1939 10 to 15 0% 8 to 12 0%","2o":"fair fair","2p":"static static","4a":"13 - $32,200","4b":"100","5a":"19 - $29,900","5b":"100"}}},{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"MultiPolygon","coordinates":[[[[-76.265295,36.845646],[-76.265438,36.845209],[-76.265747,36.845304],[-76.266142,36.845506],[-76.266246,36.845437],[-76.266082,36.84532],[-76.265849,36.845183],[-76.265587,36.844932],[-76.265373,36.844685],[-76.265216,36.844567],[-76.264946,36.84438],[-76.264689,36.844156],[-76.264558,36.843744],[-76.264511,36.843345],[-76.264511,36.843098],[-76.26456,36.842969],[-76.264663,36.842932],[-76.264993,36.842909],[-76.26517,36.843031],[-76.26559,36.84317],[-76.266151,36.843307],[-76.266784,36.843603],[-76.267034,36.843769],[-76.267444,36.843964],[-76.267694,36.843926],[-76.268145,36.843627],[-76.268668,36.843346],[-76.269268,36.843037],[-76.269977,36.842584],[-76.270979,36.842024],[-76.271855,36.841538],[-76.271964,36.841476],[-76.27341,36.841853],[-76.273511,36.842067],[-76.2742,36.842913],[-76.274794,36.843517],[-76.275282,36.844083],[-76.275507,36.84433],[-76.275919,36.844848],[-76.275111,36.845342],[-76.274517,36.845894],[-76.274113,36.846712],[-76.273899,36.847415],[-76.27378,36.848347],[-76.27378,36.848709],[-76.273543,36.84945],[-76.27359,36.849907],[-76.2734,36.850173],[-76.273481,36.851023],[-76.273481,36.851025],[-76.273089,36.851681],[-76.273063,36.85177],[-76.272839,36.852537],[-76.272376,36.853422],[-76.272293,36.853584],[-76.270917,36.853134],[-76.266242,36.851606],[-76.26627,36.851458],[-76.266206,36.851184],[-76.266113,36.850841],[-76.266074,36.850332],[-76.266131,36.850192],[-76.266074,36.85004],[-76.266021,36.849791],[-76.266022,36.849605],[-76.265943,36.849442],[-76.265878,36.849261],[-76.265979,36.849127],[-76.266263,36.848759],[-76.266085,36.848513],[-76.266113,36.848319],[-76.266021,36.848205],[-76.26575,36.848102],[-76.265579,36.847971],[-76.265751,36.847575],[-76.265657,36.847418],[-76.265694,36.847165],[-76.265618,36.846951],[-76.265751,36.846738],[-76.265507,36.846493],[-76.265358,36.846351],[-76.265251,36.846197],[-76.265152,36.845951],[-76.265129,36.84578],[-76.265295,36.845646]]]]},"properties":{"name":null,"holc_id":"D8","holc_grade":"D","area_description_data":{"2":"80% 20%","3":"0 N/A N/A","5":"4","6":"none","8":"A level area practically 100% built up.

There is a home for aged women on the corner of Park Ave. and Corprew Ave. Practically all of the original owners have long since moved out and present occupants are families of very low income. Foreclosure experience has been heavy and sales growth is north and west, while this area is located in the southeast corner of the city. Docks and shipyards are adjacent to the south and industry to the southwest. Brambleton Ave. is the principal thoroughfare and traffic is hazardous. Park Ave. is also a thoroughfare. Railroad tracks bisect the area north and south. Collections are reported to have improved in the last twelve months because of increased employment and improved family income. There is a municipal golf course adjacent to the east. Age and obsolescence have resulted in property depreciation and the neighborhood is definitely undesirable.","9":"Brambloton (Norfolk) 4th D-8 Nov. 1939","71":"9","72":"$25.00","1a":"N/A N/A Yes","1b":"Laborers - unskilled mechanics - clerks","1c":"0% N/A","1d":"0%","1e":"none","2a":"1-family 2 story, 6-7 rooms 2-family, 4-5 room conversions","2b":"frame (25' lots) frame","2c":"35 years 35 years","2d":"poor poor","2e":"98% 98%","2f":"30% 10%","2g":"800 to 2500 800 to 1000","2h":"800 to 2500 0% 800 to 1000 0%","2i":"1939 800 to 2500 0% 800 to 1000 0%","2j":"poor poor","2k":"static static","2l":"10 to 18 8 to 12.5","2m":"10 to 18 0% 8 to 12.5 0%","2n":"1939 10 to 18 0% 8 to 12.5 0%","2o":"fair fair","2p":"firm firm","4a":"4 - $11,000","4b":"50","5a":"2 - $4,200","5b":"100"}}},{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"MultiPolygon","coordinates":[[[[-76.253537,36.855581],[-76.253418,36.852975],[-76.250328,36.853166],[-76.25031,36.85258],[-76.250255,36.850762],[-76.250233,36.850066],[-76.253157,36.85018],[-76.255248,36.850161],[-76.257173,36.850142],[-76.259122,36.850161],[-76.259122,36.850181],[-76.259122,36.850408],[-76.263258,36.850427],[-76.263234,36.852158],[-76.263242,36.852467],[-76.263282,36.854079],[-76.258647,36.85482],[-76.258481,36.854934],[-76.257221,36.855448],[-76.253537,36.855581]]]]},"properties":{"name":null,"holc_id":"D9","holc_grade":"D","area_description_data":{"2":"75% 25%","3":"10 2-family, $3,000 moderately","5":"4","6":"limited","8":"A level area.
