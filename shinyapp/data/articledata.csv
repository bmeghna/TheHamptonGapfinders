0,New Song for Virginia's Children's Chorus,Coastal Virginia Magazine,https://coastalvirginiamag.com/article/new-song-for-virginia-childrens-chorus/,Virginia Beach,09/2022,"For Corbin Thomas Pinto, taking on the mantle of artistic director of the Virginia Children’s Chorus (VCC) this year is part of a lifetime of raising her voice with the VCC. “It feels very much like I’m coming home,” Pinto says.

Growing up in the area, Pinto was a member of the VCC for six years. As an adult, in addition to a life of choral leadership, teaching and performing, she directed the VCC Chamber Singers for five years and has been involved with various VCC projects for two decades.

Having recently celebrated its 30th anniversary season, the Virginia Children’s Chorus offers auditions in the fall for students in kindergarten through high school age. The students meet weekly for rehearsals and perform at venues throughout Coastal Virginia as part of four choir groups of varying levels. One of the most exciting aspects of membership in the Virginia Children’s Chorus is the opportunity to perform with professional arts organizations throughout the area like the Virginia Symphony and the Virginia Arts Festival.

Pinto says she’ll never forget performing with VCC in a production of Carl Orff’s Carmina Burana on New Year’s Eve of 2000 when she was a senior in high school. The Virginia Symphony Orchestra was playing, Pinto’s father was singing with the VSO chorus and the Governor’s School for the Arts was dancing Todd Rosenlieb’s choreography.

“With the dancers and the symphony and the choir it was just—it’s one of my favorite performing memories of all time,” she says.

Pinto also remembers traveling to England with the VCC, singing at beautiful cathedrals and performance spaces and staying with local singers. Over the years, the VCC has performed at small local venues and also at Sandler Center and Chrysler Hall, as well as touring to perform at renowned halls like Westminster Abbey and Carnegie Hall.

Pinto stresses that the VCC is an affordable way for children to get a strong musical education and quality vocal training. “We focus on making sure the kids are doing healthy singing so that their voices can be used for the rest of their lives,” she says.

“This is a group for everyone,” says Pinto. “We are all trying to raise not only students who are singing in a healthy way and who are smart musicians and can read music but also students who are empathetic and aware of how music can connect communities.”

The VCC will present its fall concert on November 20 and will be performing throughout the year.","['for', 'corbin', 'thomas', 'pinto', 'taking', 'on', 'the', 'mantle', 'of', 'artistic', 'director', 'of', 'the', 'virginia', 'children’s', 'chorus', '(vcc)', 'this', 'year', 'is', 'part', 'of', 'a', 'lifetime', 'of', 'raising', 'her', 'voice', 'with', 'the', 'vcc', '“it', 'feels', 'very', 'much', 'like', 'i’m', 'coming', 'home', '”', 'pinto', 'says', 'growing', 'up', 'in', 'the', 'area', 'pinto', 'was', 'a', 'member', 'of', 'the', 'vcc', 'for', 'six', 'years', 'as', 'an', 'adult', 'in', 'addition', 'to', 'a', 'life', 'of', 'choral', 'leadership', 'teaching', 'and', 'performing', 'she', 'directed', 'the', 'vcc', 'chamber', 'singers', 'for', 'five', 'years', 'and', 'has', 'been', 'involved', 'with', 'various', 'vcc', 'projects', 'for', 'two', 'decades', 'having', 'recently', 'celebrated', 'its', '30th', 'anniversary', 'season', 'the', 'virginia', 'children’s', 'chorus', 'offers', 'auditions', 'in', 'the', 'fall', 'for', 'students', 'in', 'kindergarten', 'through', 'high', 'school', 'age', 'the', 'students', 'meet', 'weekly', 'for', 'rehearsals', 'and', 'perform', 'at', 'venues', 'throughout', 'coastal', 'virginia', 'as', 'part', 'of', 'four', 'choir', 'groups', 'of', 'varying', 'levels', 'one', 'of', 'the', 'most', 'exciting', 'aspects', 'of', 'membership', 'in', 'the', 'virginia', 'children’s', 'chorus', 'is', 'the', 'opportunity', 'to', 'perform', 'with', 'professional', 'arts', 'organizations', 'throughout', 'the', 'area', 'like', 'the', 'virginia', 'symphony', 'and', 'the', 'virginia', 'arts', 'festival', 'pinto', 'says', 'she’ll', 'never', 'forget', 'performing', 'with', 'vcc', 'in', 'a', 'production', 'of', 'carl', 'orff’s', 'carmina', 'burana', 'on', 'new', 'year’s', 'eve', 'of', '2000', 'when', 'she', 'was', 'a', 'senior', 'in', 'high', 'school', 'the', 'virginia', 'symphony', 'orchestra', 'was', 'playing', 'pinto’s', 'father', 'was', 'singing', 'with', 'the', 'vso', 'chorus', 'and', 'the', 'governor’s', 'school', 'for', 'the', 'arts', 'was', 'dancing', 'todd', 'rosenlieb’s', 'choreography', '“with', 'the', 'dancers', 'and', 'the', 'symphony', 'and', 'the', 'choir', 'it', 'was', 'just—it’s', 'one', 'of', 'my', 'favorite', 'performing', 'memories', 'of', 'all', 'time', '”', 'she', 'says', 'pinto', 'also', 'remembers', 'traveling', 'to', 'england', 'with', 'the', 'vcc', 'singing', 'at', 'beautiful', 'cathedrals', 'and', 'performance', 'spaces', 'and', 'staying', 'with', 'local', 'singers', 'over', 'the', 'years', 'the', 'vcc', 'has', 'performed', 'at', 'small', 'local', 'venues', 'and', 'also', 'at', 'sandler', 'center', 'and', 'chrysler', 'hall', 'as', 'well', 'as', 'touring', 'to', 'perform', 'at', 'renowned', 'halls', 'like', 'westminster', 'abbey', 'and', 'carnegie', 'hall', 'pinto', 'stresses', 'that', 'the', 'vcc', 'is', 'an', 'affordable', 'way', 'for', 'children', 'to', 'get', 'a', 'strong', 'musical', 'education', 'and', 'quality', 'vocal', 'training', '“we', 'focus', 'on', 'making', 'sure', 'the', 'kids', 'are', 'doing', 'healthy', 'singing', 'so', 'that', 'their', 'voices', 'can', 'be', 'used', 'for', 'the', 'rest', 'of', 'their', 'lives', '”', 'she', 'says', '“this', 'is', 'a', 'group', 'for', 'everyone', '”', 'says', 'pinto', '“we', 'are', 'all', 'trying', 'to', 'raise', 'not', 'only', 'students', 'who', 'are', 'singing', 'in', 'a', 'healthy', 'way', 'and', 'who', 'are', 'smart', 'musicians', 'and', 'can', 'read', 'music', 'but', 'also', 'students', 'who', 'are', 'empathetic', 'and', 'aware', 'of', 'how', 'music', 'can', 'connect', 'communities', '”', 'the', 'vcc', 'will', 'present', 'its', 'fall', 'concert', 'on', 'november', '20', 'and', 'will', 'be', 'performing', 'throughout', 'the', 'year']","['celebrated', 'exciting', 'opportunity', 'favorite', 'beautiful', 'well', 'renowned', 'affordable', 'strong', 'sure', 'healthy', 'healthy', 'smart', 'will', 'will']",['trying'],9.0,2022.0,"for corbin thomas pinto  taking on the mantle of artistic director of the virginia children’s chorus (vcc) this year is part of a lifetime of raising her voice with the vcc  “it feels very much like i’m coming home ” pinto says

1,Curtain Rises Again for Hampton Arts,Coastal Virginia Magazine,https://coastalvirginiamag.com/article/curtain-rises-again-for-hampton-arts/,Virginia Beach,09/2022,"Hampton Arts is back after a two and a half year intermission. Artistic Director Richard M. Parison Jr. says that this season is about reconnecting to the community after the interruptions caused by the pandemic.

“My goal was to make this 35th anniversary season a wide ranging, eclectic stew of artistry,” Parison says. “We wanted to represent the diversity of our audiences both in the galleries at the visual arts center and onstage at the American Theatre, be a touchstone to the community.”

Hampton Arts’ signature blend of big musical acts, bold theater, visual arts and family-friendly events will be on display, and Parison says that this season is about storytelling. Season highlights include Big Bad Voodoo Daddy, DC’s Reflecting Fools and The Three Musketeers at the American Theatre and Margaret Cho at the Hampton Coliseum. Hampton Arts’ Charles H. Taylor Visual Arts Center will present the second annual Hampton Holiday Fine Arts Bazaar and From the Sea to the Stars, a curated exhibition that will celebrate Hampton’s legacy of nautical and aerospace exploration.

Parison is especially excited about the way Hampton Arts’ new Studio Theatre will add to the offerings. “I think that’s going to be a really exciting incubator for local and regional artists to perform, whether it’s jazz, comedy, improv or education,” he says.

The Life is a Cabaret series will christen the space, featuring performances from drag legend Coco Peru, jazz artist Liz Terrell and vocal powerhouse Desiree Roots presenting a concert in tribute to the music of Nancy Wilson.

“There’s just no gap between the actor and the audience in a studio theater,” says Parison.

He says that kind of intimacy, bringing audiences and performers in close communion, is one of the hallmarks of what Hampton Arts is trying to do at the American Theatre and its other performance spaces.

“We’re the boutique farm-to-table restaurant,” he says. “We want to take excellent artists, whether they’re national or local or regional and present them in a way that’s up close and personal.”

That focus on the local and regional as well as national acts led the American Theatre to put together its Lighthouse Series, which is named after the Point Comfort Lighthouse in Hampton and focuses on local artists. Among this season’s offerings in the Lighthouse Series are area favorites Riddick Dance Company, the Hampton Roads Philharmonic and Soundscapes/Peninsula Youth Orchestra].

“For 35 years, we have always been focused on providing the best in performing and visual arts—from around the world and around the corner,” says Parison.","['hampton', 'arts', 'is', 'back', 'after', 'a', 'two', 'and', 'a', 'half', 'year', 'intermission', 'artistic', 'director', 'richard', 'm', 'parison', 'jr', 'says', 'that', 'this', 'season', 'is', 'about', 'reconnecting', 'to', 'the', 'community', 'after', 'the', 'interruptions', 'caused', 'by', 'the', 'pandemic', '“my', 'goal', 'was', 'to', 'make', 'this', '35th', 'anniversary', 'season', 'a', 'wide', 'ranging', 'eclectic', 'stew', 'of', 'artistry', '”', 'parison', 'says', '“we', 'wanted', 'to', 'represent', 'the', 'diversity', 'of', 'our', 'audiences', 'both', 'in', 'the', 'galleries', 'at', 'the', 'visual', 'arts', 'center', 'and', 'onstage', 'at', 'the', 'american', 'theatre', 'be', 'a', 'touchstone', 'to', 'the', 'community', '”', 'hampton', 'arts’', 'signature', 'blend', 'of', 'big', 'musical', 'acts', 'bold', 'theater', 'visual', 'arts', 'and', 'family-friendly', 'events', 'will', 'be', 'on', 'display', 'and', 'parison', 'says', 'that', 'this', 'season', 'is', 'about', 'storytelling', 'season', 'highlights', 'include', 'big', 'bad', 'voodoo', 'daddy', 'dc’s', 'reflecting', 'fools', 'and', 'the', 'three', 'musketeers', 'at', 'the', 'american', 'theatre', 'and', 'margaret', 'cho', 'at', 'the', 'hampton', 'coliseum', 'hampton', 'arts’', 'charles', 'h', 'taylor', 'visual', 'arts', 'center', 'will', 'present', 'the', 'second', 'annual', 'hampton', 'holiday', 'fine', 'arts', 'bazaar', 'and', 'from', 'the', 'sea', 'to', 'the', 'stars', 'a', 'curated', 'exhibition', 'that', 'will', 'celebrate', 'hampton’s', 'legacy', 'of', 'nautical', 'and', 'aerospace', 'exploration', 'parison', 'is', 'especially', 'excited', 'about', 'the', 'way', 'hampton', 'arts’', 'new', 'studio', 'theatre', 'will', 'add', 'to', 'the', 'offerings', '“i', 'think', 'that’s', 'going', 'to', 'be', 'a', 'really', 'exciting', 'incubator', 'for', 'local', 'and', 'regional', 'artists', 'to', 'perform', 'whether', 'it’s', 'jazz', 'comedy', 'improv', 'or', 'education', '”', 'he', 'says', 'the', 'life', 'is', 'a', 'cabaret', 'series', 'will', 'christen', 'the', 'space', 'featuring', 'performances', 'from', 'drag', 'legend', 'coco', 'peru', 'jazz', 'artist', 'liz', 'terrell', 'and', 'vocal', 'powerhouse', 'desiree', 'roots', 'presenting', 'a', 'concert', 'in', 'tribute', 'to', 'the', 'music', 'of', 'nancy', 'wilson', '“there’s', 'just', 'no', 'gap', 'between', 'the', 'actor', 'and', 'the', 'audience', 'in', 'a', 'studio', 'theater', '”', 'says', 'parison', 'he', 'says', 'that', 'kind', 'of', 'intimacy', 'bringing', 'audiences', 'and', 'performers', 'in', 'close', 'communion', 'is', 'one', 'of', 'the', 'hallmarks', 'of', 'what', 'hampton', 'arts', 'is', 'trying', 'to', 'do', 'at', 'the', 'american', 'theatre', 'and', 'its', 'other', 'performance', 'spaces', '“we’re', 'the', 'boutique', 'farm-to-table', 'restaurant', '”', 'he', 'says', '“we', 'want', 'to', 'take', 'excellent', 'artists', 'whether', 'they’re', 'national', 'or', 'local', 'or', 'regional', 'and', 'present', 'them', 'in', 'a', 'way', 'that’s', 'up', 'close', 'and', 'personal', '”', 'that', 'focus', 'on', 'the', 'local', 'and', 'regional', 'as', 'well', 'as', 'national', 'acts', 'led', 'the', 'american', 'theatre', 'to', 'put', 'together', 'its', 'lighthouse', 'series', 'which', 'is', 'named', 'after', 'the', 'point', 'comfort', 'lighthouse', 'in', 'hampton', 'and', 'focuses', 'on', 'local', 'artists', 'among', 'this', 'season’s', 'offerings', 'in', 'the', 'lighthouse', 'series', 'are', 'area', 'favorites', 'riddick', 'dance', 'company', 'the', 'hampton', 'roads', 'philharmonic', 'and', 'soundscapes/peninsula', 'youth', 'orchestra]', '“for', '35', 'years', 'we', 'have', 'always', 'been', 'focused', 'on', 'providing', 'the', 'best', 'in', 'performing', 'and', 'visual', 'arts—from', 'around', 'the', 'world', 'and', 'around', 'the', 'corner', '”', 'says', 'parison']","['wide', 'eclectic', 'bold', 'will', 'will', 'fine', 'stars', 'will', 'especially', 'excited', 'will', 'exciting', 'will', 'tribute', 'just', 'kind', 'intimacy', 'excellent', 'well', 'dance']","['bad', 'comedy', 'close', 'trying', 'close']",9.0,2022.0,"hampton arts is back after a two and a half year intermission  artistic director richard m  parison jr  says that this season is about reconnecting to the community after the interruptions caused by the pandemic

2,Hunger for Change,Coastal Virginia Magazine,https://coastalvirginiamag.com/article/hunger-for-change/,Virginia Beach,03/2021,"Too often, I scroll food delivery apps on my phone, begrudge which grocery to visit or stare into my fridge indecisively like the cereal aisle scene in the film The Hurt Locker. I commonly refer to these as first-world problems. However, just 4.3 miles from my first-world oasis in the Norview area of Norfolk, there are communities that have only limited access to a variety of affordable and healthy food options. These communities are often referred to as food deserts.

To better understand the outcomes food disparities impose on people’s lives, I spent four months investigating the domino effects of food deserts and created an artwork titled Far from Manna in response. The work is part of an exhibit called Nourish at Virginia MOCA, on display through June 6, 2021, along with contributions by eleven other artists examining the intersection of food and art in different ways.

My hypothesis was that food serves as a catalyst for social construction, community stability and holistic individual development. Furthermore, anyone without access to proper nutrition cannot function, let alone thrive in our America. I didn’t pull this theory out of thin air. I’ve worked as a teacher with Norfolk Public Schools since 1994, and I see firsthand that a steady diet of unhealthy snacks and limited access to nutritional food makes our kids agitated, dehydrated and unable to learn.

To gain a better understanding of this epidemic, I conducted a series of interviews with St. Paul’s Community Development Corporation, Reverend Brandon Praileau of Wesley Union A.M.E. Zion Church, Lauren DeSimone of Virginia Community Capital, and most importantly, families living in Norfolk’s Young Terrace neighborhood. The neighborhood’s only grocery, Save-A-Lot Food Stores, closed in June 2020. I also practiced a sort of “method painting,” if you will. I took the HRT bus from Church and Brambleton to the Food Lion in Colley Village and purchased groceries like many people in downtown Norfolk must do when buying and transporting their food.

After my experiences interviewing, reading and riding, I began work on my 54” x 84” painting. I knew it had to be large. The images had to be present—inescapable. I began painting flat on the floor, treating the canvas like earth. My initial paint layers were the soil. Each of the printed Adinkra symbols were sown onto the surface like seeds. Each of these West African symbols carries meaning and proverb. The one that looks like a heart is another version of Sankofa, which translates to “go back and get it.” Listed too are symbols such as Bese Saka and Wawa Aba, representing abundance and perseverance. Each print also serves to represent a trip to the market. There are over 200 printings.

I purposely placed paint at a distance to which I had to walk and repaint the stamp, walk back to the painting, kneel on the floor, position the plate, press, lift and repeat. Next, I began painting layers of maps that served as tools for containing and restraining African descendants; the transatlantic slave trade, redlining, food deserts and the city of Norfolk skyline. I wrote quotes from the interviews I conducted in cursive using graphite pencil. One of those quotes belongs to Sherri who’s sitting next to Duwarn riding the number four bus with groceries arranged on blue plastic seats.  The raised edges of symbols and maps remain visible through their skin and clothing.

Far from Manna explores how the underlying intentional generational restriction and containment of Black people have served as dominoes in the run against African American advancement and created food deserts thousands of our citizens endure. As part of this process, I learned that food deserts in Norfolk are the result of established policies rooted in racism. I learned we cannot drop a grocery store into a desert to solve these durable obstructions. We must create a web of several sustainable solutions to address deep underlying architectures of social divisions. We must nourish our communities the way we nourish healthy bodies.

Food creates community. Food is a catalyst for social change. When we create sustainable models for food wealth, our social wealth will improve. We must nourish our social health. We must become socially fit in such a way that each citizen can exercise their rights, exert free will and have true ownership of their bodies. We still have work to do for inclusion of all citizens. Even now a new map, labeled opportunity zones, has been layered over these once restricted acres. Yet, the question emerges, opportunities for whom?","['too', 'often', 'i', 'scroll', 'food', 'delivery', 'apps', 'on', 'my', 'phone', 'begrudge', 'which', 'grocery', 'to', 'visit', 'or', 'stare',

to visit or stare into my fridge indecisively like the cereal aisle scene in the film the hurt locker  i commonly refer to these as first-world problems  however  just 4 3 miles from my first-world oasis in the norview area of norfolk  there are communities that have only limited access to a variety of affordable and healthy food options  these communities are often referred to as food deserts 

to better understand the outcomes food disparities impose on people’s lives  i spent four months investigating the domino effects of food deserts and created an artwork titled far from manna in response  the work is part of an exhibit called nourish at virginia moca  on display through june 6  2021  along with contributions by eleven other artists examining the intersection of food and art in different ways 

my hypothesis was that food serves as a catalyst for social construction  community stability and holistic individual development  furthermore  anyone without access to proper nutrition cannot function  let alone thrive in our america  i didn’t pull this theory out of thin air  i’ve worked as a teacher with norfolk public schools since 1994  and i see firsthand that a steady diet of unhealthy snacks and limited access to nutritional food makes our kids agitated  dehydrated and unable to learn 

to gain a better understanding of this epidemic  i conducted a series of interviews with st  paul’s community development corporation  reverend brandon praileau of wesley union a m e  zion church  lauren desimone of virginia community capital  and most importantly  families living in norfolk’s young terrace neighborhood  the neighborhood’s only grocery  save-a-lot food stores  closed in june 2020  i also practiced a sort of “method painting ” if you will  i took the hrt bus from church and brambleton to the food lion in colley village and purchased groceries like many people in downtown norfolk must do when buying and transporting their food 

after my experiences interviewing  reading and riding  i began work on my 54” x 84” painting  i knew it had to be large  the images had to be present—inescapable  i began painting flat on the floor  treating the canvas like earth  my initial paint layers were the soil  each of the printed adinkra symbols were sown onto the surface like seeds  each of these west african symbols carries meaning and proverb  the one that looks like a heart is another version of sankofa  which translates to “go back and get it ” listed too are symbols such as bese saka and wawa aba  representing abundance and perseverance  each print also serves to represent a trip to the market  there are over 200 printings 

i purposely placed paint at a distance to which i had to walk and repaint the stamp  walk back to the painting  kneel on the floor  position the plate  press  lift and repeat  next  i began painting layers of maps that served as tools for containing and restraining african descendants; the transatlantic slave trade  redlining  food deserts and the city of norfolk skyline  i wrote quotes from the interviews i conducted in cursive using graphite pencil  one of those quotes belongs to sherri who’s sitting next to duwarn riding the number four bus with groceries arranged on blue plastic seats   the raised edges of symbols and maps remain visible through their skin and clothing 

far from manna explores how the underlying intentional generational restriction and containment of black people have served as dominoes in the run against african american advancement and created food deserts thousands of our citizens endure  as part of this process  i learned that food deserts in norfolk are the result of established policies rooted in racism  i learned we cannot drop a grocery store into a desert to solve these durable obstructions  we must create a web of several sustainable solutions to address deep underlying architectures of social divisions  we must nourish our communities the way we nourish healthy bodies 

food creates community  food is a catalyst for social change  when we create sustainable models for food wealth  our social wealth will improve  we must nourish our social health  we must become socially fit in such a way that each citizen can exercise their rights  exert free will and have true ownership of their bodies  we still have work to do for inclusion of all citizens  even now a new map  labeled opportunity zones  has been layered over these once restricted acres  yet  the question emerges  opportunities for whom ","['african american', 'ate', 'be ', 'been', 'black', 'cap', 'cat', 'che', 'dis', 'drop ', 'fam', 'hang', 'hip', 'hood', 'inclusion', 'inclusion', 'ion', 'lit', 'n', 'nd', 'race', 'racism', 'rap', 'real ', 'read', 'roll ', 'school', 'sis', 'slave', 'social construction', 'steady', 'sus', 'tea', 'tho', 'trip ', 'unity ', 'yo', '', '', '', '', '', '']",34,15,43,756
3,Voices from the Garden,Hampton Roads Weekly,http://hamptonroadsweekly.com/2022/05/voices-from-the-garden/,Virginia Beach,05/2022,"Seven bronze statues of women were unveiled at nation’s first monument 

honoring the full scope of women’s contributions & achievements.

Historic Virginia women in bronze assembled on Capitol Square in Richmond to share their stories and have their voices be heard across four centuries of Virginia history. Voices from the Garden: The Virginia Women’s Monument was dedicated on Monday, October 14.

Following the National Anthem by members of the Richmond Symphony Chorus led by Lisa Fusco of VCU and an invocation by Rev. Emily Edmondson of Christ Episcopal Church in Marion, Va., the dedication ceremony featured remarks from Governor Ralph S. Northam and First Lady Pamela Northam; The Honorable Mary Margaret Whipple, vice chair of the Women’s Monument Commission; The Honorable Ryan T. McDougle (R-District 4), member of the Women’s Monument Commission; The Honorable Susan Clarke Schaar, Clerk of the Senate and member of the Women’s Monument Commission; Ivan Schwartz, founder of StudioEIS and lead sculptor of the monument; and Dr. Lauranett Lee, member of the Capitol Square Preservation Council and professor of leadership studies at the University of Richmond. A musical tribute was provided by Joyce Johnson Rouse, who sang “Standing on the Shoulders,” and closing remarks were provided by Susan Allen, chair of the Virginia Capitol Foundation and former First Lady of Virginia. 

“For far too long, we have overlooked the transformative contributions of women and other underrepresented groups to the history of this country and this Commonwealth,” said Governor Northam in his welcoming remarks. “I am proud that with the addition of this women’s monument to Capitol Square, we are finally telling a more inclusive and complete story about Virginia. We will continue fighting to expand opportunities for women and ensure real gender equality in the Commonwealth.”  

Girl Scouts representing the three councils in the Commonwealth unveiled seven bronze statues at the dedication: Cockacoeske, Pamunkey chieftain; Anne Burras Laydon, Jamestown colonist; Mary Draper Ingles, frontierswoman; Elizabeth Keckly, dressmaker and confidante to Mary Todd Lincoln; Laura Copenhaver, entrepreneur in the textile industry; Virginia Randolph, educator; Adèle Clark, suffragist and artist. More statues will be added as they are funded and completed.

The Virginia Women’s Monument is the nation’s first on the grounds of any state capitol to showcase the full range of achievements and contributions made by remarkable women in a variety of fields and endeavors. When completed, the monument’s life-size bronze statues, along with a Wall of Honor inscribed with the names of 230 notable women and room to add more names in the future, will help tell the whole story about the diversity of accomplishments, ethnicity and thought that shaped the Commonwealth of Virginia over the past 400 years. 

More than $3.7 million has been raised through generous contributions by individuals, corporations and nonprofit foundations; to date, approximately $100,000 is still needed to complete the monument. The granite plaza and the Wall of Honor were unveiled in October 2018. Each bronze statue required a financial investment of $200,000 in order to be commissioned for sculpting by the talented team of artisans, both men and women, at StudioEIS in Brooklyn, N.Y.

4,Come Back to Beauty... Come Back to the Arts,Hampton Roads Weekly,http://hamptonroadsweekly.com/2020/02/come-back-to-beauty-come-back-to-the-arts-3/,Virginia Beach,02/2020,"The Chrysler Museum of Art has been awarded a $200,000 grant from the Henry Luce Foundation and has been approved for a $65,000 Art Works grant from the National Endowment for the Arts. Both will support the upcoming exhibition Alma W. Thomas: A Creative Life. Scheduled to open in July 2021, the traveling show is co-organized by the Chrysler Museum of Art and The Columbus Museum in Georgia and includes stops at The Phillips Collection in Washington, D.C. and The Frist Art Museum in Nashville, Tenn. before closing at The Columbus Museum in 2022. The exhibition will provide a comprehensive overview of Thomas’ long life (1891–1978) with approximately 100 works, including her rarely seen theatrical designs and beloved abstract paintings. It will track her artistic journey from semi-rural Georgia to international recognition, demonstrating how her artistic practices extended to every facet of her life — from community service and teaching to gardening and dress.

“The Chrysler Museum is excited to partner with The Columbus Museum to bring the story of this groundbreaking artist to audiences across the country. The Columbus Museum’s rich collection of Thomas’ work allows for the opportunity to present an unprecedented, comprehensive look at her accomplishments,” said Chrysler Museum Director Erik Neil. “This show will uncover little known and rarely exhibited works to ensure unique discoveries, even for those who are familiar with Thomas’ creativity. A richly illustrated catalog co-published by Yale University Press will accompany the exhibition and offer new insights into Thomas’ life. We are fortunate and honored to be supported by the Henry Luce Foundation and the National Endowment for the Arts in this endeavor.”

The exhibition will be organized around multiple themes from Thomas’ experience. These themes include the context of her Washington Color School cohort, the creative communities connected to Howard University and peers who protested museums that failed to represent artists of color. Diverse artworks and archival materials will reveal the artist’s complex and deliberate artistic existence before, during and after the years of her “mature” output and career-making solo show at the Whitney Museum in 1972. 

With the addition of Resurrection to the White House Collection in 2015; acquisitions by notable public institutions, including Crystal Bridges Museum and MoMA; and a two-venue exhibition at the Tang Museum and The Studio Museum in Harlem in 2016, the time is right to reconsider Thomas’ life and legacy.

Overall, the National Endowment for the Arts has approved 1,187 grants totaling $27.3 million in the first round of fiscal year 2020 funding to support arts projects in every state in the nation, as well as the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico.  

The Art Works funding category supports projects that focus on public engagement with, and access to, various forms of excellent art across the nation; the creation of art that meets the highest standards of excellence; learning in the arts at all stages of life and the integration of the arts into the fabric of community life.","['the', 'chrysler', 'museum', 'of', 'art', 'has', 'been',

5,Manny's Movies,Hampton Roads Weekly,http://hamptonroadsweekly.com/2019/05/mannys-movies-3/,Virginia Beach,05/2019,"During our February issue, I reviewed the beginning of season two of Star Trek Discovery.  Compared to the 1st Season, I was relieved and happy with what I saw.  The first season did not stick to Star Trek canon (the timeline and rules of Star Trek).  Happily, the second season does.

The first episode opens with the USS Discovery answering a distress call from the USS Enterprise.  Remember, this is set about 10 years prior to Captain Kirk.  The commanding officer of the Enterprise is Captain Christopher Pike, played by Anson Mount.  He actually is playing the character in a similar fashion to Bruce Greenwood’s portrayal in the movies.  He has a great sense of humor and takes command of Discovery to go on a special mission for the Federation.  This is where the fun begins.  As an aside, my wife, Connie, thinks that Captain Pike reminds her of former Governor Bob McDonnell because he is handsome (her words), a great leader and has a good sense of humor.   That is a different discussion for another issue.

Over the course of the season, a plot develops and it plays perfectly into Star Trek canon and at the same time, allows for the updating and freshening of technology (as you would expect).  The special effects are big-screen movie theater quality.  The story line sets up the integration of Discovery and the Original Series.  There were some episodes where I was sitting at the edge of my seat in disbelief on how spot-on the writers were!  When it comes to Star Trek, I do not impress easily. 

The final episodes of the season set up a potential new series featuring Captain Pike, Mr. Spock and the Enterprise.  We can only hope that is what the writers and producers were thinking.  The good news is that since it is on CBS All Access, you can watch Star Trek Discovery at your convenience at anytime and anywhere.

7,Fabulous Finds Versus Salon,Hampton Roads Weekly,http://hamptonroadsweekly.com/2020/07/fabulous-finds-versus-salon/,Virginia Beach,07/2020,"Ask anyone with curly hair and they’ll tell you of their hair journey that will more often than not include tales of bad salon experiences and moments they’ve walked the line of deciding to shave it all off. You’ll also learn about the shocking amounts of money they’ve spent on products that ended up not working for them at all. This is why when Michelle Williams started Versus Salon 18 years ago, she committed to learning all that she could about curly and textured hair so that she could offer support to a curly community desperately in need.

Michelle began by becoming certified through the now popular DevaCurl brand, learning the special techniques required to properly cut curly hair, and brought the first DevaCurl inspired salon to Virginia Beach.  Ever since, she’s been on a search for the best product lines and stylist-training possible to suit curls of all types and textures.  When she opened Versus’ upgraded location just outside of Town Center seven years ago, she began sharing what she had learned with her team to ensure each of her stylists was trained to serve a diverse range of clients. 
Why is it so important that a salon specializes in curly or textured hair? These types of tresses are often treated like straight hair in most salons. In fact, cosmetology programs do not differentiate between textured hair and straight hair when teaching cutting techniques. When curly hair is cut while wet, a shape is created that does not suit the natural fall and bounce of curly hair. That means that the client ends up with an unfitting shape to their cut once their shampoo has been completed. For Versus, they see the importance of this training gap in the way clients feel about themselves and their natural hair textures. The proof is in the smiles and satisfaction (and sometimes even tears) their clients leave with. It’s more than just a good haircut – it’s allowing someone to feel confident when they get ready and look in the mirror each day.

While Versus Salon offers a range of services like braids, extensions, and unique color, the stylists’ passion is being an extensively-trained, expert resource for members of their community who find themselves frustrated with the trials-and-errors of knowing how to care for their curly hair.  Once a year, they hold a “Curls Night Out” event where they celebrate curly clients, offer expert advice, and answer client questions about managing their curly textures.  In 2020, the Versus Salon team will be expanding their efforts by offering special classes based on the needs of the clients who have entrusted them with their curls.  Topics will include “Mommy & Me” styling classes for parents who could use help dealing with their little one’s textured tresses. 

You can keep up with the special events that Versus Salon is holding by following them on social media @VersusSalon and viewing their website, www.versussalon.com. You will find their blog that is updated weekly with tips & tricks, special sales, and information to help clients of all types and textures.

8,Nope Review,Hampton Roads Messenger,https://hamptonroadsmessenger.com/posts/nope-review/,Norfolk,08/2022,"In interviews for the film, Nope, Jordan Peele has been candid about what inspired him to create his most recent movie. He explained that during the pandemic, the fate of movie theaters was up in the air. People couldn’t go to the movies and some were closing, leaving an open debate on whether seeing a film in theaters was starting to become a thing of the past. For any film lover, this is a nightmare scenario, since nothing compares to seeing something on the big screen, especially if that something is a singular experience unlike any other. Jordan Peele sought to create a spectacle worthy of that experience that would bring people into theaters eager to witness it. I’m happy to say that in every area he succeeded.

What we have with his latest film Nope is plainly the movie of the summer. In the same vein as the original Jurassic Park and the original Jaws, this film is a tentpole blockbuster that people will be talking about for years to come. It’s equal parts terrifying, hilarious, action-packed, thought-provoking and awe-inspiring. 

Daniel Kaluuya’s performance as the reserved OJ is probably the most intelligent horror movie character ever. As you watch him on the screen you nod alongside him because he makes the necessary decisions that you would be screaming at the screen if it were a lesser film. Keke Palmer provides comedic relief alongside the emotion between the two siblings as his sister Emerald. Both give Oscar-worthy performances (if the Academy had the cojones to finally show movies like this the respect they deserve.)

The first horror film ever to be filmed on 65mm IMAX by legendary cinematographer Hoyte van Hoytema, Nope talks about the idea of spectacle and how it often becomes corrupted through our society’s hunger for power. 

Our world is seemingly built on the success of people who monetize tragedy in the hopes to gain money and fame. Just look at the media in both the major and social platforms. They are both driven with one goal in mind: to present to you the most awesome things in hopes that you’ll give them your full attention, regardless of the deeper ramifications those things can have.

But Spectacle can be a good thing, this very movie being one of them.  Nope entices you to never look away. Like the very spectacle the film itself is about, the lesson here is that we must respect the nature and gravity of whatever it is that has our attention or it will consume us. 

That’s about all I can say without giving too much away. I had the privilege of seeing this movie in IMAX, and I believe that’s how it was meant to be seen. If you can, see this on the biggest screen possible because it’s the best time I’ve had at the movies all year. Maybe in the last five years.","['in', 'interviews', 'for', 'the', 'film', 'nope', 'jordan', 'peele', 'has', 'been', 'candid', 'about', 'what', 'inspired', 'him', 'to', 'create', 'his', 'most',

beauty of our environment. The chosen artist will receive a payment of
$1,200 which includes the artist fee and the purchase of appropriate exterior
metal paint, and brushes along with any other items deemed necessary by
the artist.
Linda Bunch, Suffolk Art League Executive Director, says, “This project
offers an artist the exciting opportunity to create public art at one of the
gateways to Downtown Suffolk. While a challenging dimension of 1 foot by
175 feet, this guard railing can be transformed into a head turning addition
to the landscape”.
Kathy Russell spokesperson for Keep Suffolk Beautiful says, “This is a
unique beautification project to give an old guard rail a facelift and transform
it into something special. We want to bring more art into public areas of
Suffolk and make it more welcoming to visitors. The guardrail is located not
far from the Visitors Center.”
Interested artists are encouraged to email Keep Suffolk Beautiful to receive
a design brief and have until April 22, 2022 to submit their proposal.
Proposals will include the design and list of materials. The chosen mural will

Greg Edwards decided to open the school adjacent to his tattoo studio, Greg’s Tattoos, to help prevent others from what he experienced when he entered the industry six years ago.


“I initially tried to get an apprenticeship with a local artist, but found that it wasn’t welcoming,” Edwards said.

Apprenticeships — generally unpaid — require 1,500 hours and take about two years to complete. When Edwards earned his license, he had to commute to Richmond. Greg’s Airbrush & Tattoo Academy plans to fill the void in the area. The only other tattoo school in the area was opened a few months ago by Antonio Almazan, owner of Supreme Styles Tattooing in Virginia Beach.

Edwards generated the academy’s course, which includes proper consultation etiquette, identifying parts of the tattoo machine, understanding the skin and its layers, CPR, bloodborne pathogens, sterilization, and proper needle and cartridge disposal. “I actually took some of that COVID time I was shut down to develop the curriculum,” he said.

Applicants 18 and older are being accepted for the first class, which starts July 1. The course costs $8,000 and runs 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. Monday through Friday for a total of 750 hours. Aspiring tattoo artists are required to pass the state exam following course completion, which includes the creation of 100 tattoos per student.

Alexis McCann said she’s wanted to be a tattoo artist since she was 16. The 21-year-old is one of the first to register for Edwards’ academy.

“It’s nice when you can take something that’s a long process and make it into a shorter time frame, but you’re still getting the same knowledge,” McCann said.

Edwards’ journey to tattooing was as colorful as the airbrushed wall that emblazons his studio. Originally from Louisville, Kentucky, he served six years in the Navy before he transitioned to the police force in Pensacola, Florida. He worked in asset protection security in the state of Washington and loss prevention for the Navy Exchange in Virginia Beach.

His wife, Kimberly, maintained her naval career as a corpsman and the family moved throughout the U.S. during her 20 years on active duty. The couple has three children: Camry, 26; Aubrie, 22; and Kyra, 14.

After the stock market crash, Edwards decided to “bet on himself” and return to his first love — airbrushing. He opened up a shop in Chesapeake Square Mall and remained there for 11 years before he relocated it to Portsmouth.

Edwards said he loves the stories he can tell using images.

“I’m able to generate a vision. When people ask for a design, I can visualize it as they’re speaking,” Edwards said. “Anything you can hold still, we can airbrush.”

At the urging of his friend and fellow artist, Elton Parker, he decided to take on tattooing. Parker assured Edwards he’d mastered his airbrush skills and was one of the best airbrush artists on the East Coast. “I did a little research and found there were zero Black-owned tattoo shops in the area,” Edwards said.

Interestingly enough, Edwards said Black Americans tend to spend more money on tattoos but have no representation.

“It was so hard for people of color, at the time, to get licensed,” Edwards said. “So you saw people, for the most part, working out of their homes, and that right there is a no-no. That is a huge problem that we have in this area.”

He opened Greg’s Tattoos in 2015. In six years, Edwards has learned the art of tattooing, developed as an artist, earned his instructor’s license and was named the 2020 Virginia Media best tattoo parlor in Portsmouth.

Now, he’s certified to teach others the art and help them earn their license.

“We probably do at least four or five tattoos a week that are cover-ups or corrections to people that are tattooing out of their homes,” Edwards said. “It’s going to help bring people from out of the shadows.”","['portsmouth', '—', 'the', 'first', 'black-owned', 'tattoo', 'academy', 'in', 'the', '757', 'opens', 'its', 'doors', 'this', 'summer', 'in', 'portsmouth', 'greg', 'edwards', 'decided',

Since then, she and other artists have looked for alternatives to get in front of people and earn a living.

“This is our bread and butter,” Frederick said. “We’ve tried to find other ways to make it.”

When an opportunity came up in the ViBe Creative District at the Oceanfront, Frederick submitted a proposal.

She was one of eight regional artists — each from culturally diverse backgrounds — who were selected to paint murals on neighborhood sculptures last weekend. The art can be seen on the corners of the intersections along 19th Street.

They received a $1,000 stipend and money for supplies. The project was supported in part by grants from the Virginia Beach Arts & Humanities Commission and others.

Artists were encouraged to paint images that offered “a positive outlook or inclusive vision of diversity,” inspired by a quote by poet Maya Angelou: “Try to be a rainbow in someone else’s cloud.”

Tamika Bright-Stubblefield of Newport News painted a pair of green hands holding a colorful flower.

“There may be tough rainy days, but if we look within ourselves and take the time to be a light, and water some else’s garden, we ultimately grow as well,” the artist wrote in her proposal.

Frederick, 31, tapped into one of her favorite childhood memories. She grew up in rural North Carolina and didn’t have cable TV or video games. She played outside with her siblings and cousins.

They used to find dandelions and would have a contest to see who who could blow away the fuzzy seeds from the dandelion first while they made wishes.

She painted a little girl blowing on a dandelion in hopes that passersby will be transported back to a happy memory when they see it.

In Frederick’s proposal, she described why she chose the image.

“This simple little game is something that the adult-me tends to reflect on when thinking of positive childhood experiences and relationships that get me through the day during these trying times —especially as a black woman in the United States,” she wrote. “At the same time, these memories take me back to a time when childhood whimsy, wonder, and excitement was the only weight on my shoulders.”","['children’s', 'book', 'illustrator', 'yvonne', 'frederick', 'of', 'norfolk', 'used', 'to', 'sell', 'her', 'art', 'at', 'anime', 'and', 'comic', 'con', 'conventions', 'across',

14,Problems and creative solutions: Pharrell Williams launches advocacy agency after NSU panel,13NewsNow,https://www.13newsnow.com/article/news/local/mycity/norfolk/pharrell-williams-launches-advocacy-agency-nsu-panel/291-6c3a5131-b9b5-4d59-9720-8e36341690a8,Norfolk,09/2022,"NORFOLK, Va. — Virginia Beach native and Grammy award-winning singer and songwriter Pharrell Williams announced that he and a team of other industry leaders are launching a first-of-its-kind advocacy agency on Monday. 

First reported by Adweek and confirmed by sources close to Pharrell, ""Mighty Dream"" will be an agency that looks for solutions to problems that are faced by marginalized communities. 


Norfolk business owners say Mighty Dream will include a block party, focusing on entrepreneurs, in the NEON District this November.

13News Now reached out to Downtown Norfolk council leaders about the possibility of an event in Norfolk involving Pharrell and his team. They sent back the group’s website showing “Mighty Dream” as a multi-day forum from November 1 to November 3.

The website reads: 

""MIGHTY DREAM is an annual gathering of global business leaders advancing diversity, equity and inclusion within their organizations. The multi-day forum of thought leadership, idea exchange, networking, progressive conversation and engaging food & entertainment experiences is designed to broker honest, direct dialogue and relationships that accelerate the progress many are already demonstrating.""

There is also a place to sign up for a newsletter to find out when tickets go on sale.

Its an idea that came in the aftermath of Pharrells ""Elephant in the Room"" business forum at Norfolk State University last fall, where he met with local city leaders to discuss issues in Hampton Roads and how a road can be paved going forward. 

The forum gave Pharrell a chance to show the financial resources that are available to Hampton Roads to create better businesses. It also gave him a chance to hit on the need for diversity and inclusivity.

It was a feeling of inclusivity that Pharrell had initially hoped to bring to Virginia Beach and the region with his “Something in the Water” festival back in 2019. 

This year, the festival returned after a hiatus due to the pandemic, but was instead held in Washington D.C. 

The move comes after Pharrell expressed his disappointment in the way the city handled the death of his cousin, Donovon Lynch, at the hands of a police officer in March of 2021. At his forum in October, Pharrell said he wants to move past the controversy surrounding it, but he needs to see real change.

“If someone asks me what inspires me, I always say, ‘That which is missing.’ It’s the clearest path to being additive to society and finding new solutions for real problems,” Williams said in an interview with Adweek about the new agency. 

He will be the co-chair and founder, and ""Mighty Dream"" will also be the first of its kind to have an executive board made up entirely of leaders who are persons of color in different creative industries. 

“Mighty Dream aims to create what’s missing: in creativity, in advocacy, in society.”

Lisa Osborne Ross, CEO of Edelman U.S., will be the other co-chair, according to Adweek. 

“It is literally designed to look at the issues that are affecting communities of color—Black people in particular—and what can brands do to address those societal issues,” she said in the Adweek interview.","['norfolk', 'va', '—', 'virginia', 'beach', 'native', 'and', 'grammy', 'award-winning', 'singer', 'and', 'songwriter', 'pharrell', 'williams', 'announced', 'that', 'he', 'and', 'a',

Cuffee Outreach and Innovation Library, tables were stacked with books covering everything from romance to children’s topics — all written by local authors.

Musicians, including Shark City Drum & Dance Corps, played while visitors browsed what the vendors had to offer at the Chesapeake Public Library’s fourth annual Black Ink: Block Party and Lit Fest.

Saturday’s event celebrated local authors, artists and musicians of color. Roughly 60 authors and vendors sold books, artwork, clothing and more, coming together to make a few sales, meet other artists and writers and share what they do.

For Newberry Medal winner and Great Bridge High School graduate Kwame Alexander, it was a chance to release his latest book, “The Door of No Return” in his hometown, days ahead of its official release. He said Chesapeake was the first stop of his 14-city book tour.

“This is a homecoming, and it feels great to be able to come back to the city that helped me become who I was, that raised me, that nurtured me into becoming this writer,” Alexander, 54, said. “It feels good to come back and be able to offer something.”

The Black Ink: Block Party and Lit Fest featured a number of Black authors and businesses from across the region. The Black Ink: Block Party and Lit Fest was held at the Dr. Clarence V. Cuffee Library in Chesapeake on Sept. 24, 2022.

Alexander’s writing journey included a handful of rejections before finally getting published. He won the Newberry Medal for “The Crossover” in 2015. His message to the crowd before he sat to sign books: Say “yes” to yourself. If he hadn’t, he said, his work likely wouldn’t have been recognized.

Aderonke Adeleke, an Old Dominion University student and a Virginia Young Poet in the Community winner, performed her piece, “Imaginary Things,” which highlighted her parents’ experience as immigrants from Nigeria.

The event helps the local community grow and share their stories, she said.

“The greatest thing is there are a lot of people around here that have something to say,” Adeleke said. “And people of color who have that opportunity to give other people of color the opportunity to say that, I think that’s just amazing.”","['outside', 'the', 'dr', 'clarence', 'v', 'cuffee', 'outreach', 'and', 'innovation', 'library', 'tables', 'were', 'stacked', 'with', 'books', 'covering', 'everything', 'from', 'romance', 'to', 'children’s', 'topics', '—', 'all', 'written', 'by', 'local', 'authors', 'musicians', 'including', 'shark', 'city', 'drum', '&', 'dance', 'corps', 'played', 'while', 'visitors', 'browsed', 'what', 'the', 'vendors', 'had', 'to', 'offer', 'at', 'the', 'chesapeake', 'public', 'library’s', 'fourth', 'annual', 'black', 'ink', 'block', 'party', 'and', 'lit', 'fest', 'saturday’s', 'event', 'celebrated', 'local', 'authors', 'artists', 'and', 'musicians', 'of', 'color', 'roughly', '60', 'authors', 'and', 'vendors', 'sold', 'books', 'artwork', 'clothing', 'and', 'more', 'coming', 'together', 'to', 'make', 'a', 'few', 'sales', 'meet', 'other', 'artists', 'and', 'writers', 'and', 'share', 'what', 'they', 'do', 'for', 'newberry', 'medal', 'winner', 'and', 'great', 'bridge', 'high', 'school', 'graduate', 'kwame', 'alexander', 'it', 'was', 'a', 'chance', 'to', 'release', 'his', 'latest', 'book', '“the', 'door', 'of', 'no', 'return”', 'in', 'his', 'hometown', 'days', 'ahead', 'of', 'its', 'official', 'release', 'he', 'said', 'chesapeake', 'was', 'the', 'first', 'stop', 'of', 'his', '14-city', 'book', 'tour', '“this', 'is', 'a', 'homecoming', 'and', 'it', 'feels', 'great', 'to', 'be', 'able', 'to', 'come', 'back', 'to', 'the', 'city', 'that', 'helped', 'me', 'become', 'who', 'i', 'was', 'that', 'raised', 'me', 'that', 'nurtured', 'me', 'into', 'becoming', 'this', 'writer', '”', 'alexander', '54', 'said', '“it', 'feels', 'good', 'to', 'come', 'back', 'and', 'be', 'able', 'to', 'offer', 'something', '”', 'the', 'black', 'ink', 'block', 'party', 'and', 'lit', 'fest', 'featured', 'a', 'number', 'of', 'black', 'authors', 'and', 'businesses', 'from', 'across', 'the', 'region', 'the', 'black', 'ink', 'block', 'party', 'and', 'lit', 'fest', 'was', 'held', 'at', 'the', 'dr', 'clarence', 'v', 'cuffee', 'library', 'in', 'chesapeake', 'on', 'sept', '24', '2022', 'the', 'black', 'ink', 'block', 'party', 'and', 'lit', 'fest', 'featured', 'a', 'number', 'of', 'black', 'authors', 'and', 'businesses', 'from', 'across', 'the', 'region', 'the', 'black', 'ink', 'block', 'party', 'and', 'lit', 'fest', 'was', 'held', 'at', 'the', 'dr', 'clarence', 'v', 'cuffee', 'library', 'in', 'chesapeake', 'on', 'sept', '24', '2022', '(billy', 'schuerman/the', 'virginian-pilot)', 'alexander’s', 'writing', 'journey', 'included', 'a', 'handful', 'of', 'rejections', 'before', 'finally', 'getting', 'published', 'he', 'won', 'the', 'newberry', 'medal', 'for', '“the', 'crossover”', 'in', '2015', 'his', 'message', 'to', 'the', 'crowd', 'before', 'he', 'sat', 'to', 'sign', 'books', 'say', '“yes”', 'to', 'yourself', 'if', 'he', 'hadn’t', 'he', 'said', 'his', 'work', 'likely', 'wouldn’t', 'have', 'been', 'recognized', 'aderonke', 'adeleke', 'an', 'old', 'dominion', 'university', 'student', 'and', 'a', 'virginia', 'young', 'poet', 'in', 'the', 'community', 'winner', 'performed', 'her', 'piece', '“imaginary', 'things', '”', 'which', 'highlighted', 'her', 'parents’', 'experience', 'as', 'immigrants', 'from', 'nigeria', 'the', 'event', 'helps', 'the', 'local', 'community', 'grow', 'and', 'share', 'their', 'stories', 'she', 'said', '“the', 'greatest', 'thing', 'is', 'there', 'are', 'a', 'lot', 'of', 'people', 'around', 'here', 'that', 'have', 'something', 'to', 'say', '”', 'adeleke', 'said', '“and', 'people', 'of', 'color', 'who', 'have', 'that', 'opportunity', 'to', 'give', 'other', 'people', 'of', 'color', 'the', 'opportunity', 'to', 'say', 'that', 'i', 'think', 'that’s', 'just', 'amazing', '”']","['innovation', 'dance', 'celebrated', 'great', 'great', 'able', 'good', 'able', 'greatest', 'opportunity', 'opportunity', 'just', 'amazing']","['shark', 'black', 'block', 'black', 'block', 'black', 'black', 'block', 'black', 'block', 'black', 'black', 'block']",9.0,2022.0,"outside the dr  clarence v  cuffee outreach and innovation library  tables were stacked with books covering everything from romance to children’s topics — all written by local authors

16,‘Love is here’: Hundreds gathered for block party in Williamsburg to celebrate Juneteenth,The Virginian-Pilot,https://www.pilotonline.com/virginiagazette/va-vg-wburg-juneteenth-0622-20220621-ostzh574hzcr3jhfnhqanm7j44-story.html,Norfolk,06/2022,"The Triangle block in downtown Williamsburg was once a bustling area of Black businesses and residences, until redevelopment in the 1970s changed the landscape.

But on Sunday, in the shadow of historic First Baptist Church — one of the oldest Black churches in the country, the Triangle came to life with the Juneteenth Freedom Celebration. Part block party, part educational outreach, the event brought out hundreds of community members to commemorate the end of slavery in the United States.

The celebration, called “Honoring the Ancestors,” was part of Juneteenth events around the country. Long celebrated in Black communities but only recognized as a national holiday in 2021, Juneteenth marks the day in 1865 when enslaved people in Galveston, Texas, found out they were freed — more than two years after President Abraham Lincoln’s Emancipation Proclamation.

Many attendees called events like the Freedom Celebration “a wonderful beginning. ... It’s a good event to start a tradition,” said Dylan Pritchett, a self-described storyteller who grew up in Williamsburg. “It’s important that we get together, but what do we do now as a community? Hopefully it will expand and there will be more community involvement now that people know what it is.”

The event, one of several throughout the Williamsburg area over the weekend, was organized by the Village Initiative and Williamsburg Action, two groups that work for equity and justice through education and awareness. The afternoon was filled with music, drumming, food, dancing, art, camaraderie and, according to organizers, joy.

“Juneteenth is about joy,” said Antonia Darnella, head of Williamsburg Action. “It’s uplifting. It feels safe. It feels like love. It feels like love is here.”

As an organization, the Village Initiative, which started in 2016 as an effort to equalize education, strives to be “bridge builders” in the community, to bring together all ages, races and demographics, said founder Jacqueline Bridgeforth-Williams. On Sunday, the bridge building “really came through,” she said, evident by the diverse crowd that spilled over from the church lawn and parking lot into the junction of blocked-off Prince George and Scotland streets.

“We’re celebrating in a place that there were a lot of memories,” Bridgeforth-Williams said. “I know the ancestors were pleased. Going back generations ... and I’m talking about going back to those enslaved who arrived here back in 1619. I know they were smiling and rejoicing somewhere.”

For the past few years, the Viliage Initiative, in partnership with the College of William & Mary and Williamsburg-James City County Schools, been spearheading the Local Black Histories Project. The educational project is documenting the history of the Black community in Williamsburg, collecting more than 100 histories so far.

The project was on display at the celebration as Steve Prince, the director of engagement and artist in residence at William & Mary’s Muscarelle Museum of Art, led a community art project. Attendees could paint puzzle pieces that would fit together to create the outlines of two figures — Mrs. Bessie Skinner Gerst and Dr. J. Blaine Blayton, two notable members of Williamsburg’s Black community. Gerst opened a kindergarten for Black students during the years of segregation, while Blayton was the first Black physician in Williamsburg and the first Black member of the James City County School Board.

“It’s community engagement, but it’s also teaching people about the power of art,” Prince said, who planned to paint the head and hands himself to finish off the large wooden pieces that will be part of a traveling art exhibit.

For a public art display, Juneteenth attendees painted puzzle pieces that would fit together to create outlines of two of Williamsburgs pioneering Black residents, including Bessie Skinner Gerst, who ran a kindergarten out of her home during segregation to address racial disparities.

From the line dancing to the red velvet cupcakes, from voter registration to free children’s books, there was a lot to learn and smile and laugh about at Sunday’s event. But, said organizers and community members alike, the fight for equality and justice continues.

“I love this country. It’s a great country,” said Herb Jones, who is running for Congress and spoke briefly at the event. “We’ve made great progress. … or have we? We have a lot to celebrate, but there’s a lot of irony and there’s a lot of work that still needs to be done.”","['the', 'triangle', 'block', 'in', 'downtown', 'williamsburg', 'was', 'once', 'a',

changed the landscape 

but on sunday  in the shadow of historic first baptist church — one of the oldest black churches in the country  the triangle came to life with the juneteenth freedom celebration  part block party  part educational outreach  the event brought out hundreds of community members to commemorate the end of slavery in the united states 

the celebration  called “honoring the ancestors ” was part of juneteenth events around the country  long celebrated in black communities but only recognized as a national holiday in 2021  juneteenth marks the day in 1865 when enslaved people in galveston  texas  found out they were freed — more than two years after president abraham lincoln’s emancipation proclamation

many attendees called events like the freedom celebration “a wonderful beginning      it’s a good event to start a tradition ” said dylan pritchett  a self-described storyteller who grew up in williamsburg  “it’s important that we get together  but what do we do now as a community  hopefully it will expand and there will be more community involvement now that people know what it is ”

the event  one of several throughout the williamsburg area over the weekend  was organized by the village initiative and williamsburg action  two groups that work for equity and justice through education and awareness  the afternoon was filled with music  drumming  food  dancing  art  camaraderie and  according to organizers  joy 

“juneteenth is about joy ” said antonia darnella  head of williamsburg action  “it’s uplifting  it feels safe  it feels like love  it feels like love is here ”

as an organization  the village initiative  which started in 2016 as an effort to equalize education  strives to be “bridge builders” in the community  to bring together all ages  races and demographics  said founder jacqueline bridgeforth-williams  on sunday  the bridge building “really came through ” she said  evident by the diverse crowd that spilled over from the church lawn and parking lot into the junction of blocked-off prince george and scotland streets 

“we’re celebrating in a place that there were a lot of memories ” bridgeforth-williams said  “i know the ancestors were pleased  going back generations     and i’m talking about going back to those enslaved who arrived here back in 1619  i know they were smiling and rejoicing somewhere ”

for the past few years  the viliage initiative  in partnership with the college of william & mary and williamsburg-james city county schools  been spearheading the local black histories project  the educational project is documenting the history of the black community in williamsburg  collecting more than 100 histories so far 

[ project documents oral histories of the black community in williamsburg ]

the project was on display at the celebration as steve prince  the director of engagement and artist in residence at william & mary’s muscarelle museum of art  led a community art project  attendees could paint puzzle pieces that would fit together to create the outlines of two figures — mrs  bessie skinner gerst and dr  j  blaine blayton  two notable members of williamsburg’s black community  gerst opened a kindergarten for black students during the years of segregation  while blayton was the first black physician in williamsburg and the first black member of the james city county school board 

“it’s community engagement  but it’s also teaching people about the power of art ” prince said  who planned to paint the head and hands himself to finish off the large wooden pieces that will be part of a traveling art exhibit

The Chrysler Museum of Art recently received $225,000 in grants for the show, “Black Orpheus: Jacob Lawrence & the Mbari Club,” which will open in fall 2022 and will travel to the New Orleans Museum of Art and the Toledo Museum of Art in Ohio in 2023, the Chrysler stated in a news release. The museum received $100,000 from The Andy Warhol Foundation for the Visual Arts, $100,000 from the Getty Foundation and $25,000 from the Wyeth Foundation for American Art.

The show is co-curated by Kimberli Gant, the Chrysler Museum of Art’s McKinnon curator of modern and contemporary art, and Ndubuisi Ezeluomba, the New Orleans Museum of Art’s Françoise Billion Richardson Curator of African art.

The exhibition will include 139 works, including paintings, lithographs, woodblock prints and pieces by artists featured in the Mbari arts and culture magazine “Black Orpheus.”

The magazine came to fruition in 1957 under two Nigeria-based German scholars specializing in African literature and art, Ulli Beier and Janheiz Jahn. They later started a small publishing arm that produced books about contemporary African writing.

In 1961, the Mbari Artists & Writers Club was founded, made up of artists, dramatists and writers such as Ezekiel Mphahlele, Wole Soyinka and Chinua Achebe. The group organized art exhibitions, theatrical performances and creative dialogues, and several artists, including Lawrence, had their first exhibitions there.

In 1964, Lawrence and his wife spent nearly a year in Nigeria, creating paintings and drawings of Lagos and Ibadan marketplaces.

The Chrysler’s show will explore the connection between Lawrence and West African-based artists at a time when social and political activism were on the rise, specifically after Nigeria earned Independence from Britain on Oct. 1, 1960. It includes 25 original letters, issues of “Black Orpheus,” two archival videos featuring Mbari Club artists and paintings, sculptures, reliefs and textiles. The show opens on Oct. 7, 2022, the 65th anniversary of the launch of “Black Orpheus,” and the 60th anniversary of Lawrence’s first exhibition in Nigeria.

Chrysler Museum of Art’s director, Erik Neil, said the show is “ambitious” and will help visitors better understand Lawrence and introduce them to artists who may not be as well-known in the U.S.

Gant said the exhibition will examine artistic shifts in Nigeria during its first decade of independence.

“The project will explore the importance of international exchange between African American and African artists, an area that also needs further research,” Gant said in the release. “We are grateful to receive such generous support for this exhibition.”","['next', 'year', 'a', 'unique', 'exhibition', 'by', 'jacob', 'lawrence', 'one', 'of', 'the', 'century’s', 'most', 'celebrated', 'african',

18,Endangered artifact provides a glimpse of 1907 Jamestown Exposition through eyes of Black photographer,The Virginian-Pilot,https://www.pilotonline.com/virginiagazette/va-vg-jamestown-antiquity-0122-20220121-7k6mu374snbqjk5zpm5svkws7a-story.html,Norfolk,01/2022,"A color image of the “Negro Building, 1907 Jamestown Exposition,” owned by the Jamestown-Yorktown Foundation, is an item in this year’s Top 10 Endangered Artifacts Program sponsored by the Virginia Association of Museums.

An online voting competition is being conducted through Jan. 27 on the VAM website with the public determining by the largest number of responses. The winner will receive a $2,000 grant toward the artifact’s conservation.

‘We have the ability through this program to conserve this artifact and the funding will be critical to that endeavor,” explained Jane Hohensee, curatorial registrar for the Jamestown-Yorktown Foundation.

“Get out there and vote for our artifact.”

The JYF artifact is a photograph on glass produced in 1907 by African American artist and photographer Arthur L. Macbeth, then of Charleston, South Carolina. Its image, within a 5-by-7-inch original aluminum frame, is smaller in size, Hohensee said. The artifact came to the foundation in 2013 as part of a donation of exposition items.

It was probably mass produced as a souvenir of the Jamestown Ter-Centennial Exposition, celebrating the 300th anniversary of the Jamestown colony’s establishment in 1607, held on a 367-acre site at Norfolk’s Sewells Point, now the home of U.S. Naval Station Norfolk.

Among Macbeth’s accomplishments is a patent for a picture project theater concept to show stereopticon and moving pictures and a 1907 Jamestown Exposition award for photography.

Hohensee emphasized, “artifacts are living things and live after their makers. This particular piece of art is in a state of deterioration and needs to be conserved to continue to tell stories of photographer and the history of the building and all the related history and to be available to generations that come after us.”

Photographer Macbeth may have used the Autochrome color photography method that was in its infancy, having been introduced in earlier 1907, Hohensee said. The gelatin glass negative or dry plate process for color photographs had gone into general manufacture in 1878 and was available to be used at that time.

How the photograph was produced “is one of the questions we hope a specialist conservator can identify,” she said. “We also want the conservator to assess its condition and recommend to us what interventions can be made to prevent further deterioration.”

The other significant element of the photograph is “The Negro Building” itself. The building’s history is a significant part of the legacy of the exposition, which was a financial disaster and not complete for its scheduled spring 1907 opening.

Norfolk author and historian Amy Waters Yarsinske, in her book, “Jamestown Exposition: American Imperialism on Parade” Vol. 2, said it was no surprise that “African Americans were not included in the plans laid out by the commissioners of the Jamestown Exposition Company … with Jim Crow laws in full force and segregation they produced in the southern states.”

“African Americans were forced to finance and build their own contribution to the Jamestown exposition.”

The Negro Development and Exposition Company of the U.S.A., headquartered in Richmond and founded by Blacks, was the moving force behind the Negro Building at the exposition. Black leaders across the nation, however, were divided over whether there should be a Negro Building at the celebration.

“Those African Americans who argued for participating in the Jim Crow segregated exposition were led by Booker T. Washington (Virginia native and then president of Tuskegee Institute), and those against were led by W.E.B. Du Bois,” the Black northern activist who felt more active action should be undertaken against white supremacy, Cynthia Hawkins wrote in her University of Buffalo, State University of New York, doctoral dissertation, 2019, “African American Agency and the Art Objects, 1868 to 1917.”

“Virginia’s African American elites forged ahead with plans for the Negro Building using the opportunity to demonstrate their accomplishments, and intimated how much more expansive their contribution to the country could be if white racism relented.”

Richmond lawyer and entrepreneur Giles B. Jackson secured a state charter of the Negro Development and Exposition Co. with the support of the state-supported Jamestown Exposition Co., headed by Fitzhugh Lee, nephew of Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee.

Jackson was “respected by white Virginians because he had been General Lee’s body servant during the Civil War,” Hawkins wrote, and began soliciting money to build “a pavilion to house the Negro exhibit.”

Ultimately, with the endorsement of the Virginia General assembly, Jackson was able to secure addition funds — $100,000 — from the U.S. Congress.

The building was constructed by Black laborers, supervised by Black contractors, Bolling and Everett of Lynchburg.

Architect W. Sidney Pittman of Washington, D.C., and son-in-law of Washington, was selected by the Negro Development and Exposition Company, to design the structure, which was 213 feet long by 139 feet wide, two stories high and built of wood and “pebble dash” or plaster walls.

Pittman, considered one of the most accomplished Black architects in America, was initially recognized for his design of churches, but later broaden the scope of his work to civil structures, manufacturing plants, schools and fraternal projects.

In planning for the building, Jackson wanted the exhibits inside “to provide evidence of African American advancement and ability,” Hawkins wrote. Objects for the exhibits were collected from all over the country and included fine arts, paintings and sculpture.

John Thomas Wilkes in his 2003 University of Richmond master’s thesis, “Enough Glory for Us All”: The ‘Negro Exhibit’ at the Jamestown Tercentennial Exposition,” wrote:

“The technical skills and innovative qualities of African Americans burst forth in a 1,200 square foot collection of inventions, manufactures and mechanical devices.” He said that the New York Age, a weekly newspaper, proclaimed, “The Negro exhibit is a marvel and reflects great credit upon the race, considering the adverse circumstances under which it was gotten up.”

Wilkes wrote, “after its closing, the ‘Negro’ exhibit had silenced most critics. It had overcome countless obstacles in its quest for a showing of the highest order.”

President Theodore Roosevelt visited the Negro Building on June 10, 1907, and spoke briefly at the site before an estimated 6,000 persons. Later, Aug. 3 was designated “Negro Day” at the exposition and Washington gave the principal address before about 10,000 persons standing in front of the building.

As part of the exposition’s report, an estimated 750,000 people visited the Negro Building during the commemoration.

Jackson hoped that after the exposition ended, the building and its contents could be saved. However, support for moving the building to Richmond to serve as a permanent national museum died for a lack of funding, Wilkes explained.

Within a year, the Negro Building, as well as most of the other structures at the site, was demolished and exhibit artifacts returned to their owners.

Other artifacts in this year’s Top 10 Virginia endangered items include a 1944 honor board at Bridgewater College recognizing those alumni men and women serving in World War II; an 1889 Gelatin glass negative of Natural Bridge with Thomas Jefferson’s family cabin in the photograph, Camera Heritage Museum in Staunton; and a late 1800s painting of Lewis Nusbaum, one of the major Jewish leaders of Norfolk, currently in the Ohef Sholom Temple archives.

The Fredericksburg Area Museum, Loudoun Heritage Farm Museum, Loudoun Museum, Patrick Henry’s Red Hill Home, Virginia Museum of Natural History and the Virginia Tech Corps of Cadets Museum also have endangered items in the Top 10 list.","['a', 'color', 'image', 'of', 'the', '“negro', 'building', '1907', 'jamestown', 'exposition', '”', 'owned', 'by', 'the', 'jamestown-yorktown', 'foundation',

an online voting competition is being conducted through jan  27 on the vam website with the public determining by the largest number of responses  the winner will receive a $2 000 grant toward the artifact’s conservation 

‘we have the ability through this program to conserve this artifact and the funding will be critical to that endeavor ” explained jane hohensee  curatorial registrar for the jamestown-yorktown foundation 

“get out there and vote for our artifact ”

the jyf artifact is a photograph on glass produced in 1907 by african american artist and photographer arthur l  macbeth  then of charleston  south carolina  its image  within a 5-by-7-inch original aluminum frame  is smaller in size  hohensee said  the artifact came to the foundation in 2013 as part of a donation of exposition items

it was probably mass produced as a souvenir of the jamestown ter-centennial exposition  celebrating the 300th anniversary of the jamestown colony’s establishment in 1607  held on a 367-acre site at norfolk’s sewells point  now the home of u s  naval station norfolk 

among macbeth’s accomplishments is a patent for a picture project theater concept to show stereopticon and moving pictures and a 1907 jamestown exposition award for photography 

hohensee emphasized  “artifacts are living things and live after their makers  this particular piece of art is in a state of deterioration and needs to be conserved to continue to tell stories of photographer and the history of the building and all the related history and to be available to generations that come after us ”

photographer macbeth may have used the autochrome color photography method that was in its infancy  having been introduced in earlier 1907  hohensee said  the gelatin glass negative or dry plate process for color photographs had gone into general manufacture in 1878 and was available to be used at that time 

how the photograph was produced “is one of the questions we hope a specialist conservator can identify ” she said  “we also want the conservator to assess its condition and recommend to us what interventions can be made to prevent further deterioration ”

the other significant element of the photograph is “the negro building” itself  the building’s history is a significant part of the legacy of the exposition  which was a financial disaster and not complete for its scheduled spring 1907 opening

president theodore roosevelt visited the negro building on june 10  1907  and spoke briefly at the site before an estimated 6 000 persons  later  aug  3 was designated “negro day” at the exposition and washington gave the principal address before about 10 000 persons standing in front of the building 

as part of the exposition’s report  an estimated 750 000 people visited the negro building during the commemoration 

jackson hoped that after the exposition ended  the building and its contents could be saved  however  support for moving the building to richmond to serve as a permanent national museum died for a lack of funding  wilkes explained 

within a year  the negro building  as well as most of the other structures at the site  was demolished and exhibit artifacts returned to their owners

Running from Oct. 22 through Dec. 31, 2025, “‘I made this: The Work of Black American Artists and Artisans,” can be seen in the Miodrag and Elizabeth Ridgely Blagojevich Gallery of the DeWitt Wallace Decorative Arts Museum.

“Colonial Williamsburg has long sought to acquire objects that illustrate the diverse nature of early American society,” said chief curator Ronald Hurst, The Colonial Williamsburg Foundation’s senior vice president for education and historic resources. “The documented works of gifted Black artists and artisans have long been included in our exhibitions, but we rarely had the opportunity to mount an exhibition that looks solely at this rich body of material.

“This is an important and timely undertaking.”

The 30 objects on display were selected from 140 objects recommended by a diverse advisory group representing historic trades, orientation, museum theater, orientation, historic sites, curatorial services and archaeology and conservation departments. Among the objects are works by noted Black artists and artisans including David Drake, Bill Traylor, Thornton Dial Sr., Cesar Chelor, Clementine Hunter, William Edmondson and members of the Gee’s Bend, Alabama, quilting community, according to the Art Museums.

Approximately 20 people took part in the selection process, said Laura Barry, the Foundation’s curator of paintings, drawings and sculpture.

The process to create the exhibit began about 2 1/2 years ago and involved working with conservationists to make sure the selected objects were stable and ready for show, Barry said. The exhibition design team and curators were charged with drafting labels, coordinating cataloguing and photography.

The title for the exhibit, “I made this…,” relates to a 19th-century artisan named David Drake. Drake was an enslaved American potter who dated and signed his pieces, “I made this,” denoting literacy which at the time was illegal for slaves.

Drake’s five-gallon, ash-glazed jug, made at a South Carolina plantation, is among the exhibition items and considered a prime example of his potting techniques.

Another featured artist is Sarrah Ann Pollard, a 19th-century student at the Salem African School in Salem, Massachusetts, where she learned how to stitch and make samplers. She studied under Clarissa Lawrence who, in 1832, became a charter member of the Salem Women’s Anti-Slavery Society and chair of the society’s committee for the Salem School. Eventually, she became a delegate to the third annual Anti-Slavery Convention of American Women.

A new addition to the Foundation’s furniture collection is Thomas Day’s side chair. Day, a free Black craftsman from Milton, North Carolina, learned his art from his father and, following his father’s death, opened his own operation from the 1820s to 1861. He employed free Black, white and enslaved workers in furniture and architectural woodwork manufacturing.

Considered a first-rate, highly regarded craftsman, Day was also politically oriented and attended the Fifth Annual Convention for the Improvement of the Free People of Colour in Philadelphia in 1835.

Moving into the 20th century, the exhibition will showcase a 1993 watercolor on paper by internationally-acclaimed artist Thornton Dial Sr. titled “Painting.” Born into a sharecropping family in Bessemer, Alabama, at the dawn of the Great Depression, Dial worked many jobs ranging from carpentry to iron work, spending 26 years with the Pullman Standard Company. Intrigued and inspired by machine illustrations at Pullman, he began to use varied forms of art as a canvas for personal feelings.

Having lived through racial segregation, discrimination, prejudice, civil rights unrest and Jim Crow actions, the self-taught Dial’s works also reflect history. The tiger was a symbol for him that represented the Black male and his life struggles and empowerment. His “Painting” illustrates that emotional focus.

The works of Dial, who died in 2016, remain strong reminders of his messages and his passion for communicative art. He once said “Art is like a bright star up ahead in the darkness of the world. It can lead peoples through the darkness and help them from being afraid of the darkness. Art is a guide for every person who is looking for something.”

Dial’s artwork, which has been noted for his use of recycled materials, has been compared to that of Jackson Pollock and Willem de Kooning and is in collections at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Smithsonian, Museum of Modern Art, Hirshhorn and Whitney Museum of American Art.

In celebration of the Black artists’ exhibit, the Art Museums is also offering special programming that includes “Expert Insights” talks with Colonial Williamsburg curators and educators related to the artists and artisans featured. The talks take place on Tuesdays at 10:30 a.m. on Oct. 25, Nov. 1, 8 and 15.

On Wednesdays at 3 p.m. on Oct. 26, Nov. 2, 9 and 16, visitors can join “Works by Black Artists and Artisans” tours of the museum’s galleries. A “Works by Black Artists and Artisans Conference” will be held Nov. 10-11, 2023, featuring lectures from founding members of “Black Craftspeople Digital Archives.”

When Wesh’s father saw all that she’d done and heard about Floyd’s death, he sent her a text.

“It’s time to come home,” he said. “There is work to be done.”

She moved back to Hampton Roads in November, and now helps Black business owners and artists thrive and promote their work.

Her latest collaboration, “Black Art Reframed: A Celebration of Black Excellence in art, food and music,” is a fundraiser set for Friday at Norfolk State University’s James Wise Gallery. Ticket sales end Thursday, and a portion of sales will go to the university.

Artists of the evening include Lakaye Mbah, Ray Johnson, Naomi Hall and Chris Green, who Wesh represents. He’ll be painting live as the music plays.

The show starts at 6 p.m., and will include live entertainment every hour, Wesh said, including classical music, jazz and funk, as well as complimentary vegan appetizers from chef Kaylen Brown of Real Food Meal Prep.

In the lineup are solo violinist, Maricia Atkinson McCleese, Fusion Groove Band, who will be playing a rendition of Sam Cooke’s “A Change is Gonna Come,” jazz saxophonist Michael Giamille, Norfolk State alumni and soprano Denise Nicole Battle and grand pianist Torrin Purkett.

Calling the 21+ event a “one-of-a-kind immersive, Black cultural experience,” Wesh said there’s a semi-formal dress code, so no shorts and sneakers. Masks are required unless guests are eating or drinking.

Wesh was inspired to host events like this and uplift Black creatives after suffering racial discrimination at the Victim Witness Program at the Virginia Beach Office of the Commonwealth’s Attorney.

She interned there in 2016, and out of 90 workers there, she was one of nine Black employees, some of whom said they suffered discrimination. Their pleas for help were initially ignored, but eventually her demand for an internal investigation was granted, she said.

She took time off in May 2017 to travel and heal in Europe, and two months later, her claims at the office were corroborated.

Wesh moved to New Zealand in 2019 on a working holiday visa, where she volunteered and worked closely with the Black community, including journalist Dione Joseph and Black Creatives Aotearoa, a group that encourages Black creatives to work together.

After moving back to Hampton Roads in November, she started to curate her own events, transforming studios and businesses into pop-up galleries, finding artists and entertainers and giving overlooked artists a chance. She started planning “Black Art Reframed” this summer, and pitched the idea to Norfolk State since it’s an HBCU — historically Black college or university — and the school’s vision matches her own.

Wesh wants to use art, music and vegan food to strengthen community outreach and engagement, encourage healthier lifestyles and raise money so the university can give local artists more opportunities.

Working with artists like Chris Green inspired her to host events like the upcoming fundraiser at NSU.

“I realized how difficult it was to find gallery space for Black artists,” Wesh said. “I wanted Chris to be able to showcase and sell his work to art collectors that truly appreciate Black art without him having to dilute or diminish his work.”

Through her business, Got Blacklisted, she does just that, and makes sure she can get the word out about local artists.

She named the business after her own experience.

“When I went to file federal charges against the City of Virginia Beach regarding the founded evidence of racial harassment a Norfolk EEOC rep told me if I went through with the case that I would get blacklisted,” Wesh wrote.

The company is Black-owned, led by women and helps Black artists, entrepreneurs and entertainers get exposure.

“It is a safe space for creatives who — for far too long — have been oppressed, marginalized, tokenized and exploited for profit,” Wesh said.

Amid the group in a heavy overcoat and holding a dark fedora was team captain, standout quarterback Arthur A. “Art” Matsu.

Several days later, Matsu became the hero of the game, closing out his incredible four-year career with a 47-yard drop-kick field goal to provide the margin in the 9-6 triumph over the University of Chattanooga.

The victory gave the “Fighting Virginians,” as the team was often called, “a good claim to the Southern title.” Matsu “literally finished in a blaze of glory” and “soared to meteoric heights in the fitting climax to such a gridiron career as he has experienced with the warriors of the Green, Gold and Silver,” proclaimed The Flat Hat, the W&M student newspaper.

It may have been Matsu’s idea to have the team pose on the gigantic mountain rock because, if nothing else, with a Japanese-born father and a Scottish mother, he was blessed with a flare to be noticed.

That notice continued in 2021, when the W&M Board of Visitors named an arcade in Walter J. Zable Stadium at Cary Field after the late Matsu, who was the first Asian American student to attend the college.

Later then Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam announced that a new historical marker will honor Matsu, one of five persons of Asian American and Pacific Island ancestry to be recognized for contributions to Virginia and the nation.

Historically, Matsu’s story at W&M is important because his admission to the college in 1923 was almost a contradiction “given how Jim Crow laws at the time would have banned Black people from entering the college, while allowing a Japanese Scottish immigrant to do so,” wrote Benming “Benny” Zhang in his 2016 senior W&M honors thesis. Zhang went on to serve a four-year term on Williamsburg’s City Council.

To take the racial matter a step further, the Virginia General Assembly, passed a law — the Racial Integrity Act — in 1924, several months after Matsu arrived on campus, prohibiting marriage between whites and non-whites, such as Blacks or Asians. Therefore, in Virginia the marriage of Matsu’s parents would have been illegal.

Matsu came to W&M from Cleveland after his family had earlier immigrated to Canada. His Ohio hometown was cited frequently in campus publications during his four-year stint while his racial background was played down. Off campus, however, the newspapers “would repeatedly refer to him” using racial slurs or Japanese, despite having been born in Scotland, Zhang explained.

Records indicate he was the first Asian American captain of a football team in the U.S.

His athleticism helped shape his identity at W&M, where he was well-liked both on and off the athletic fields. He played football and was the team’s quarterback, then as is the case now, a vital position on offense. He also played baseball and basketball and was on the track team, where he was the pole vaulter.

On campus, Matsu was known and active from his first days at the school as a leader when in 1923 he was elected secretary of his freshman class. Through his years he became a member of Alpha Kappa Psi, co-ed business fraternity, two secret societies — the “13″ Club and B.B. Club — and was a member of the Honor Council organization on the Sophomore Tribunal and the Senior Council.

Also, Matsu was president of the Monogram (Varsity) Club his senior year and a member of Omicron Delta Kappa, a national leadership society of select men on campus. The Colonial Echo, the campus yearbook his senior year named him the “student who has done the most for the College.”

In 1972 he was among the founding members of the Order of the White Jacket, those men and women who waited tables in the college dining halls as well as food establishments around town, like the Pocahontas Tea Room at College Corner.

It was, however, on the gridiron that Matsu made his enduring mark at W&M. In the mid-1920s football was still a young, brutal sport and required “manhood” to play it. It was not until the arrival of J. Wilder Tasker as head football coach and director of athletics that W&M’s football team achieve successive winning seasons. Prior to Tasker football at the school was, at best, mediocre.

As a precursor to his collegiate athletic career, Matsu’s youthful athletic talent drew the attention of nationally syndicated sports columnist Paul Purman, whose words appeared in about 200 newspapers across the nation. On July 5, 1917, Purman said all-round “athlete de luxe” Jim Thorpe would have a tip of his hat “to this Japanese youth … who doesn’t balk at anything in the athletic line except auto racing and poker.”

Purman said the 13-year old Matsu: “plays first base on a Boy Scout team, plays first base on an undefeated indoor baseball team, plays halfback on a high school football team, plays forward on an amateur basketball team, has pole vaulted 7 feet 4 ½ inches, more than a foot higher than any boy of his class, holds Cleveland junior record for the 100, 50 and 75 yard dashes, plays a fair game of tennis, is a fair broad jumper, a champion boy swimmer at Cleveland Y.M.C.A. and caddies at a golf course.

“Then when Arthur gets through doing all these things he goes home and cultivates his war garden. … Some boy, what?” Purman concluded. Later in high school Matsu won the national scholastic diving championship.

Matsu was recruited by Princeton University and W&M. He explained later that he selected the college because Coach Tasker offered him the ability to play football immediately and he did.

He was one of only two freshmen to make the 25-man roster and beat out two Virginia natives for the quarterback slot, even though he was among the smallest players on the team at 5 feet 9 inches and weighing 143 pounds.

He was considered a triple threat — running, passing and kicking.

In his first game against the Naval Academy The Flat Hat wrote that Matsu was one of the stars of the game, kicking a drop-kick field goal. At the end of his inaugural season, The Flat Hat said of Matsu: “he has proved himself to be a stellar field general, and has made a wonderful record in his one year on the varsity.”

In a later game against the University of Delaware, which Delaware won, 14-0, The Flat Hat praised Matsu for his “brilliant” field leadership and his talent.

In 1924 Meb Davis, a freshman end, joined the team and the Matsu-to-Davis passing combination was created. The combination “completely guzzled the Navy eleven with nine of 13 passes completed,” the school’s yearbook proclaimed. In W&M’s 21-3 win over Trinity (later Duke University) Matsu to Davis passes accounted for two of the three touchdowns.

During Matsu’s W&M career, the team played some of the major football schools in the east, such as Syracuse, Navy, Harvard and Columbia. In October 1925 prior to the game against Harvard, a New York sports writer wrote:

“Harvard probably will face something new Saturday in playing William and Mary College to the extent of being opposed by a Japanese quarterback. Yale had a Chinese shortstop but so far as known, Art Matsu is the only Japanese playing college football in the east … (Matsu) is a splendid player and good field general.”

Although W&M lost, 14-7, The New York Times wrote: “Matsu, the quarterback, who is of Scotch and Japanese parents, played a splendid game. Besides punting in fine fashion and making some steady advances when he carried the ball, the tall and thin player saved his team many times when he called the plays so that the Crimson defense was baffled.”

After being named to an All-Southern team after the 1925 season, sportswriters continued to lavish praise on his gridiron talents. One writer said, “An able, consistent punter, good ball carrier, and sure tackler, the Japanese makes up in brains and speed what he lacks in poundage.”

In 1926, his last collegiate year, W&M won more football games, seven, than in any other previous year and in his four years with coach Tasker, Matsu and his team compiled a 24-12-1 record.

In his last game, the “championship” contest, Matsu managed a 75-yard punt that went down in the W&M records as the longest, until Jackie Freeman’s 77-yard effort in 1940. Two other players Russ Brown in 1972 and Joe Agee in 1975 equaled that mark. Matsu’s punt, however, is still legendary.

Matsu graduated in 1928 with degrees in business administration and economics but he still yearned for football. That fall he played professional football for the Dayton Triangles, one of the original National Football League teams. He was the second Asian American to play in the NFL following Dayton’s Walter “Sneeze” Achiu in 1926 and the first Asian American quarterback. He played in six of the seven games, starting as quarterback in four. He was the first college alumnus to play in the NFL.

In those days, the players were paid about $50 per game and game tickets were $1.75 each.

In 1929 Matsu became head football coach at Asheville High School in Asheville, North Carolina, and in 1930 moved to Richmond to coach football at Benedictine College Preparatory School.

Tasker, who left William & Mary after the 1927 season became head coach at Rutgers University in 1931 and immediately hired Matsu as his backfield coach. He remained with Rutgers’ football until 1955. During his 25 years, Matsu was coach of the freshman team on several occasions and rose to the rank of associate professor in the physical education department.

Frank Burns, a Rutgers quarterback in the school’s post-World War II power-house teams of 1945-1948, joined Matsu on the Scarlet Knights staff in 1955. He said Matsu “was a master of offensive football, a true innovator.” Burns also described him as “one of the best football minds I’ve ever met, an excellent teacher.”

Matsu was working in New Jersey during at the onset of World War II and the Japanese bombing of Pearl Harbor. According to a recent story by Dave Johnson for W&M Athletics, Matsu was not sent to an internment camp, like Japanese families on the West Coast, but was “restricted,” his daughter Nancy Matsu Hulse, told the college’s oral history program. He was not allowed to leave New Jersey.

“I do know from information that I have that he tried to get into the military,” said Hulse. “The president of Rutgers had helped him, but because he was 50% Japanese that didn’t happen.”

In 1960 he moved to Arizona where he worked in real estate and helped legendary Arizona State coach Frank Kush, who from 1958-1979 compiled a record of 176-54-1. For a number of years Matsu was a scouting coach for Kush, scouting for Arizona State.

On Oct. 10, 1963, Arizona Republic sports writer Dave Hicks penned Arizona State’s No. 1 football critic was Matsu. The 59-year-old was asked by Kush “to praise or pan, laud or lambast the Sun Devils and their coaching strategy.” After most games Matsu’s observations from the press box reach Kush “in the form of an 8-10 page report.

“Kush doesn’t always agree with the findings, but admits the critical analysis he requested sometimes provide information overlooked by his staff in the heat of battle,” Hicks said. “Matsu’s pen can blister or blandish” and his scouting report often with both barrels firing is the only scouting report Kush and his staff see.”

Matsu visited campus in October 1969 when he was part of the 35 men in the initial class of the William & Mary Sports Hall of Fame. Joining Matsu in that first class was teammate Meb Davis, the other half of the Matsu to Davis passing combination. His last visit to campus was with friends in 1972.

postseason gridiron game  amid the group in a heavy overcoat and holding a dark fedora was team captain  standout quarterback arthur a  “art” matsu 

several days later  matsu became the hero of the game  closing out his incredible four-year career with a 47-yard drop-kick field goal to provide the margin in the 9-6 triumph over the university of chattanooga

the victory gave the “fighting virginians ” as the team was often called  “a good claim to the southern title ” matsu “literally finished in a blaze of glory” and “soared to meteoric heights in the fitting climax to such a gridiron career as he has experienced with the warriors of the green  gold and silver ” proclaimed the flat hat  the w&m student newspaper 

it may have been matsu’s idea to have the team pose on the gigantic mountain rock because  if nothing else  with a japanese-born father and a scottish mother  he was blessed with a flare to be noticed 

that notice continued in 2021  when the w&m board of visitors named an arcade in walter j  zable stadium at cary field after the late matsu  who was the first asian american student to attend the college 

later then virginia gov  ralph northam announced that a new historical marker will honor matsu  one of five persons of asian american and pacific island ancestry to be recognized for contributions to virginia and the nation 

historically  matsu’s story at w&m is important because his admission to the college in 1923 was almost a contradiction “given how jim crow laws at the time would have banned black people from entering the college  while allowing a japanese scottish immigrant to do so ” wrote benming “benny” zhang in his 2016 senior w&m honors thesis  zhang went on to serve a four-year term on williamsburg’s city council 

to take the racial matter a step further  the virginia general assembly  passed a law — the racial integrity act — in 1924  several months after matsu arrived on campus  prohibiting marriage between whites and non-whites  such as blacks or asians  therefore  in virginia the marriage of matsu’s parents would have been illegal 

matsu came to w&m from cleveland after his family had earlier immigrated to canada  his ohio hometown was cited frequently in campus publications during his four-year stint while his racial background was played down  off campus  however  the newspapers “would repeatedly refer to him” using racial slurs or japanese  despite having been born in scotland  zhang explained 

records indicate he was the first asian american captain of a football team in the u s 

his athleticism helped shape his identity at w&m  where he was well-liked both on and off the athletic fields  he played football and was the team’s quarterback  then as is the case now  a vital position on offense  he also played baseball and basketball and was on the track team  where he was the pole vaulter 

on campus  matsu was known and active from his first days at the school as a leader when in 1923 he was elected secretary of his freshman class  through his years he became a member of alpha kappa psi  co-ed business fraternity  two secret societies — the “13″ club and b b  club — and was a member of the honor council organization on the sophomore tribunal and the senior council 

also  matsu was president of the monogram (varsity) club his senior year and a member of omicron delta kappa  a national leadership society of select men on campus  the colonial echo  the campus yearbook his senior year named him the “student who has done the most for the college ”

in 1972 he was among the founding members of the order of the white jacket  those men and women who waited tables in the college dining halls as well as food establishments around town  like the pocahontas tea room at college corner 

it was  however  on the gridiron that matsu made his enduring mark at w&m  in the mid-1920s football was still a young  brutal sport and required “manhood” to play it  it was not until the arrival of j  wilder tasker as head football coach and director of athletics that w&m’s football team achieve successive winning seasons  prior to tasker football at the school was  at best  mediocre 

as a precursor to his collegiate athletic career  matsu’s youthful athletic talent drew the attention of nationally syndicated sports columnist paul purman  whose words appeared in about 200 newspapers across the nation  on july 5  1917  purman said all-round “athlete de luxe” jim thorpe would have a tip of his hat “to this japanese youth … who doesn’t balk at anything in the athletic line except auto racing and poker ”

purman said the 13-year old matsu “plays first base on a boy scout team  plays first base on an undefeated indoor baseball team  plays halfback on a high school football team  plays forward on an amateur basketball team  has pole vaulted 7 feet 4 ½ inches  more than a foot higher than any boy of his class  holds cleveland junior record for the 100  50 and 75 yard dashes  plays a fair game of tennis  is a fair broad jumper  a champion boy swimmer at cleveland y m c a  and caddies at a golf course 

“then when arthur gets through doing all these things he goes home and cultivates his war garden  … some boy  what ” purman concluded  later in high school matsu won the national scholastic diving championship 

matsu was recruited by princeton university and w&m  he explained later that he selected the college because coach tasker offered him the ability to play football immediately and he did

he was one of only two freshmen to make the 25-man roster and beat out two virginia natives for the quarterback slot  even though he was among the smallest players on the team at 5 feet 9 inches and weighing 143 pounds 

he was considered a triple threat — running  passing and kicking 

in his first game against the naval academy the flat hat wrote that matsu was one of the stars of the game  kicking a drop-kick field goal  at the end of his inaugural season  the flat hat said of matsu “he has proved himself to be a stellar field general  and has made a wonderful record in his one year on the varsity ”

in a later game against the university of delaware  which delaware won  14-0  the flat hat praised matsu for his “brilliant” field leadership and his talent 

in 1924 meb davis  a freshman end  joined the team and the matsu-to-davis passing combination was created  the combination “completely guzzled the navy eleven with nine of 13 passes completed ” the school’s yearbook proclaimed  in w&m’s 21-3 win over trinity (later duke university) matsu to davis passes accounted for two of the three touchdowns 

during matsu’s w&m career  the team played some of the major football schools in the east  such as syracuse  navy  harvard and columbia  in october 1925 prior to the game against harvard  a new york sports writer wrote

“harvard probably will face something new saturday in playing william and mary college to the extent of being opposed by a japanese quarterback  yale had a chinese shortstop but so far as known  art matsu is the only japanese playing college football in the east … (matsu) is a splendid player and good field general ”

although w&m lost  14-7  the new york times wrote “matsu  the quarterback  who is of scotch and japanese parents  played a splendid game  besides punting in fine fashion and making some steady advances when he carried the ball  the tall and thin player saved his team many times when he called the plays so that the crimson defense was baffled ”

after being named to an all-southern team after the 1925 season  sportswriters continued to lavish praise on his gridiron talents  one writer said  “an able  consistent punter  good ball carrier  and sure tackler  the japanese makes up in brains and speed what he lacks in poundage ”

in 1926  his last collegiate year  w&m won more football games  seven  than in any other previous year and in his four years with coach tasker  matsu and his team compiled a 24-12-1 record 

in addition to his passing skills  art matsu was an excellent punter and kicker  courtesy of special collections research center  swem library  william & mary

in his last game  the “championship” contest  matsu managed a 75-yard punt that went down in the w&m records as the longest  until jackie freeman’s 77-yard effort in 1940  two other players russ brown in 1972 and joe agee in 1975 equaled that mark  matsu’s punt  however  is still legendary 

matsu graduated in 1928 with degrees in business administration and economics but he still yearned for football  that fall he played professional football for the dayton triangles  one of the original national football league teams  he was the second asian american to play in the nfl following dayton’s walter “sneeze” achiu in 1926 and the first asian american quarterback  he played in six of the seven games  starting as quarterback in four  he was the first college alumnus to play in the nfl 

in those days  the players were paid about $50 per game and game tickets were $1 75 each 

in 1929 matsu became head football coach at asheville high school in asheville  north carolina  and in 1930 moved to richmond to coach football at benedictine college preparatory school 

tasker  who left william & mary after the 1927 season became head coach at rutgers university in 1931 and immediately hired matsu as his backfield coach  he remained with rutgers’ football until 1955  during his 25 years  matsu was coach of the freshman team on several occasions and rose to the rank of associate professor in the physical education department 

frank burns  a rutgers quarterback in the school’s post-world war ii power-house teams of 1945-1948  joined matsu on the scarlet knights staff in 1955  he said matsu “was a master of offensive football  a true innovator ” burns also described him as “one of the best football minds i’ve ever met  an excellent teacher ”

matsu was working in new jersey during at the onset of world war ii and the japanese bombing of pearl harbor  according to a recent story by dave johnson for w&m athletics  matsu was not sent to an internment camp  like japanese families on the west coast  but was “restricted ” his daughter nancy matsu hulse  told the college’s oral history program  he was not allowed to leave new jersey 

“i do know from information that i have that he tried to get into the military ” said hulse  “the president of rutgers had helped him  but because he was 50% japanese that didn’t happen ”

in 1960 he moved to arizona where he worked in real estate and helped legendary arizona state coach frank kush  who from 1958-1979 compiled a record of 176-54-1  for a number of years matsu was a scouting coach for kush  scouting for arizona state 

on oct  10  1963  arizona republic sports writer dave hicks penned arizona state’s no  1 football critic was matsu  the 59-year-old was asked by kush “to praise or pan  laud or lambast the sun devils and their coaching strategy ” after most games matsu’s observations from the press box reach kush “in the form of an 8-10 page report 

“kush doesn’t always agree with the findings  but admits the critical analysis he requested sometimes provide information overlooked by his staff in the heat of battle ” hicks said  “matsu’s pen can blister or blandish” and his scouting report often with both barrels firing is the only scouting report kush and his staff see ”

matsu visited campus in october 1969 when he was part of the 35 men in the initial class of the william & mary sports hall of fame  joining matsu in that first class was teammate meb davis  the other half of the matsu to davis passing combination  his last visit to campus was with friends in 1972

24,Revolutionary Black portrait exhibition opens at UVA,the Virginian-Pilot,https://www.pilotonline.com/entertainment/arts/black-virginians-portraits-20220924-ymniuop6jrbrzmbyvkyww5ukua-story.html,Norfolk,09/2022,"During the Jim Crow era, when minstrel shows and racist caricatures accounted for nearly all visual representations of Black people, hundreds of Black Virginians from Charlottesville, Albemarle County and Nelson County commissioned distinguished self-portraits that shattered stereotypes.

The Holsinger Collection exhibit, titled Visions of Progress: Portraits of Dignity, Style and Racial Uplift featuring photographs taken by well-known Charlottesville photographer Rufus Holsinger, will be on display at the University of Virginia Albert and Shirley Small Collections Library through September 2023.

The collection has the power to change the historical narrative of Black life in Central Virginia during the 19th and early 20th century. The subjects in each portrait commissioned the photos from the University Studio, which was on West Main Street where Mel’s Cafe is now located.

According to a brochure written by the organizers of The Holsinger Portrait Project, there is no evidence that Holsinger himself was a racial liberal. In fact, as a member of the Charlottesville City Council, he supported an ordinance that segregated residential areas.

“We’ve spent a lot of time learning about what the statues of Robert E. Lee and Stonewall Jackson meant and the messages that they sent in support of white supremacy. We haven’t spent very much time learning about what the Black folks were doing,” said John Edwin Mason, a UVa professor of African history and the history of photography.

Mason is the director of the Holsinger Portrait Project.

“This exhibition is all about how Black folks not only survived, but how they, in some ways, morally and psychologically prospered during that time,” Mason said.

The entire studio collection, also stored at the Small Collections Library, includes 10,000 images with 611 portraits of Black subjects. Most of the images in the collection include names and details about who those people were, but the names were determined by who paid for the photoshoot rather than who is in the photos.

The contents of each portrait are unique. Some are of individuals. Some feature family units. Some include photo subjects in traditional early 20th Century formal clothing and others show people dressed in the latest fashions. But each contributes to the variety and diversity of Black Central Virginians at the time.

Modern-day portraits have become a habit for most school children and employees, but the images in the Holsinger Collection were a symbol of resistance to racial oppression and harmful stereotypes.

Although the portraits were taken during a time of tremendous racial injustice and violence, the people in them do not look like what they have been through.

During the early 20th century, job options for Black women were overwhelmingly confined to domestic servant positions, while most Black men worked in hard labor industries. In contrast with the other imagery of Black blue collar employees in the early 1900s, the Holsinger Collection portraits do not feature Black people in soiled work clothes.

“We know that when people imagine what African Americans looked like over 100 years ago in Central Virginia, they do not imagine these beautiful portraits of style and panache,” Mason said.

“They weren’t defined by their oppression. They weren’t defined by their jobs as housemaids or janitors. They were defined by their personal dignity and their conviction that they were equal to anybody else and deserve the full rights to citizenship.”

The research that led to the establishment of The Holsinger Portrait Project began near the end of 20th century. That’s when the late Reginald Butler, a former UVa history professor, and Scott French, the former associate director of the Carter G. Woodson Institute, mounted a small exhibition of portraits from the collection.

That display sparked the idea for The Holsinger Portrait Project, Mason says. That vision finally came to life in 2019 during the first Family Photo Day hosted by the Holsinger Studio at the Jefferson School in an effort to identify some of the photo subjects yet to be named.

The event was a chance to “connect the photographs and names of the past with the ongoing story of African Americans in the Charlottesville region,” according to the Holsinger Studio website.

Families are invited to view images in the collection and even bring family photos of their own, which could also help the studio’s search for lost names.

Family Photo Day set the precedent for The Holsinger Portrait Project’s mission to educate the Charlottesville, Albemarle County, Nelson County and Virginia communities about an untapped area of Black history.

After the exhibition opening, The Holsinger Portrait Project will go on tour around Virginia, starting with primary and secondary schools. It will use 500 images from the collection to educate young Virginians about the reality, prosperity and hope of the Black people in each image.","['during', 'the', 'jim', 'crow', 'era', 'when',

caricatures accounted for nearly all visual representations of black people  hundreds of black virginians from charlottesville  albemarle county and nelson county commissioned distinguished self-portraits that shattered stereotypes 

the holsinger collection exhibit  titled visions of progress portraits of dignity  style and racial uplift featuring photographs taken by well-known charlottesville photographer rufus holsinger  will be on display at the university of virginia albert and shirley small collections library through september 2023 

teen dies hours after being shot in newport news
the collection has the power to change the historical narrative of black life in central virginia during the 19th and early 20th century  the subjects in each portrait commissioned the photos from the university studio  which was on west main street where mel’s cafe is now located 

according to a brochure written by the organizers of the holsinger portrait project  there is no evidence that holsinger himself was a racial liberal  in fact  as a member of the charlottesville city council  he supported an ordinance that segregated residential areas 

“we’ve spent a lot of time learning about what the statues of robert e  lee and stonewall jackson meant and the messages that they sent in support of white supremacy  we haven’t spent very much time learning about what the black folks were doing ” said john edwin mason  a uva professor of african history and the history of photography 

mason is the director of the holsinger portrait project 

“this exhibition is all about how black folks not only survived  but how they  in some ways  morally and psychologically prospered during that time ” mason said 

the entire studio collection  also stored at the small collections library  includes 10 000 images with 611 portraits of black subjects  most of the images in the collection include names and details about who those people were  but the names were determined by who paid for the photoshoot rather than who is in the photos 

the contents of each portrait are unique  some are of individuals  some feature family units  some include photo subjects in traditional early 20th century formal clothing and others show people dressed in the latest fashions  but each contributes to the variety and diversity of black central virginians at the time 

modern-day portraits have become a habit for most school children and employees  but the images in the holsinger collection were a symbol of resistance to racial oppression and harmful stereotypes 

although the portraits were taken during a time of tremendous racial injustice and violence  the people in them do not look like what they have been through 

during the early 20th century  job options for black women were overwhelmingly confined to domestic servant positions  while most black men worked in hard labor industries  in contrast with the other imagery of black blue collar employees in the early 1900s  the holsinger collection portraits do not feature black people in soiled work clothes 

“we know that when people imagine what african americans looked like over 100 years ago in central virginia  they do not imagine these beautiful portraits of style and panache ” mason said 

“they weren’t defined by their oppression  they weren’t defined by their jobs as housemaids or janitors  they were defined by their personal dignity and their conviction that they were equal to anybody else and deserve the full rights to citizenship ”

the research that led to the establishment of the holsinger portrait project began near the end of 20th century  that’s when the late reginald butler  a former uva history professor  and scott french  the former associate director of the carter g  woodson institute  mounted a small exhibition of portraits from the collection 

that display sparked the idea for the holsinger portrait project  mason says  that vision finally came to life in 2019 during the first family photo day hosted by the holsinger studio at the jefferson school in an effort to identify some of the photo subjects yet to be named 

the event was a chance to “connect the photographs and names of the past with the ongoing story of african americans in the charlottesville region ” according to the holsinger studio website 

families are invited to view images in the collection and even bring family photos of their own  which could also help the studio’s search for lost names 

family photo day set the precedent for the holsinger portrait project’s mission to educate the charlottesville  albemarle county  nelson county and virginia communities about an untapped area of black history 

after the exhibition opening  the holsinger portrait project will go on tour around virginia  starting with primary and secondary schools  it will use 500 images from the collection to educate young virginians about the reality  prosperity and hope of the black people in each image ","['african american', 'ate', 'be ', 'been', 'black', 'cat', 'che', 'dis', 'diversity', 'fam', 'hang', 'hip', 'ice ', 'ion', 'justice', 'lit', 'n', 'nd', 'oppression', 'power', 'racist', 'rap', 'school', 'serve ', 'sis', 'stereotype', 'tho', 'yo', '', '', '', '', '', '']",23,23,34,797

Anyone taking their final flight test for the Single Operator Utility Vehicles must meet Wednesday, Dec. 5, in Hangar Echo at 0500 hours.

Double shooting in Norfolk leaves woman dead, man injured, police say
As if crew members needed more bait, Snipes included a snazzy color image of the flyer — an open-top, tugboat-shaped vessel zooming high above the Portsmouth Aeroshipbuilding waterfront with other SOUVs streaking underneath it.

""Roger that 0500 ECHO,"" one crew member replied to the post.

Another: ""Ill have em all gassed up and ready to roll by 0430…Gotta have time for coffee.""

Snipes is the ""public information officer"" at The Portsmouth Aeroshipbuilding Co., an alternate universe that resembles the Norfolk Naval Shipyard that Snipes grew up near in Portsmouth. It can only feel like home, though. At this Portsmouth yard, ships are built to fly.

A year ago, Snipes created this world in his head and digitally painted it in to play with on Facebook.

Then other people wanted to play along.

Portsmouth Aeroshipbuilding is what happens when self-proclaimed geeks grow up and their imagination, tools and skills finally fuse and reveal what makes them tick.

Snipes works as a digital marketing manager at his bills-paying job.

At night, often pre-dawn, hes dreaming up illustrations, stretching the art skills he learned at I.C. Norcom High and Norfolk State University in the 1980s.

With this, he began by sketching floating tankers, tugboats and Navy carriers emerging from clouds, complete with swarms of pesky seagulls. He shrouded them in a historical look with a futuristic feel.

He knew from his job that digital campaigns worked magic for his clients. He wondered if he could use a similar social media approach to create a story.

Snipes needed a backstory and realized that the vessels could only be made at a sprawling network of buildings and cranes like the one embedded in his hometown memories.

His aeroshipbuilding enterprise suddenly had a home and a name.

Each week, hed develop a craft and slowly reveal its evolution along with the workers who built it. The shipyard is set in the 1940s when the world is at war and America is in dire need of brilliance.

Its found at Portsmouth where engineers have learned to harness gravity and manipulate moving tons of metal with ""gravitational displacement technology,"" or GDT.

Snipes had to create the theory because of the more than 5,000 viewers who visit his site weekly, several were engineers who had to know, ""How can ships fly?""

Snipes said: ""I had to have an out.""

He also set the scene in the past because he loved the blooming personality of the 1940s — its jazz-flavored air, the zoot suits and women with back-seamed stockings. It was also a time when America was struggling with a new identity and found it in the rally for the war effort.

""You picture everyday folks that built those big old ships that helped win the war for us; thats amazing,"" Snipes said. ""As I looked at old photos to get a feel for the story, a lot of those photos were of women who stepped up. This was somebodys mother and grandmother back in the day who worked to make sure were not all speaking German now.""

In his world, most of the top-notch pilots are African American women. Occasionally, the famed Tuskegee Airmen, real African American pilots in WWII, visit Aeroshipbuilding to advise on aircraft design.

Bessie Stringfield, one of the few, if not only, African American motorcycle dispatch riders during World War II, came by the fictional company to help develop a flying motorcycle called the ""Piranha."" Its missiles, like those in WWII, include painted warnings to the German leader, Adolf Hitler.

Snipes rakes the internet for historical footage and audio to post, such as ""man-on-the-street"" interviews that reporters had with people in the days following the 1941 attack on Pearl Harbor. He looks for photos and merges them almost seamlessly with his illustrations.

Tony Snipes took a historical photograph from the shipyard and added airships and his own image, standing fourth from the right, for his Portsmouth AeroshipBuildingCompany series, photographed on Friday, Nov. 23, 2018.

His Facebook page contains actual photos of wartime ship production, but then there are glimpses of Snipes in the yard, surveying the sky for stories, or ""sitting"" at a table with singer Ella Fitzgerald who stopped by to entertain the crowd on a Friday.

The Facebook page reads like an employee newsletter — no strict plot, no major characters, just snippets of life behind the gates. Occasionally, he mixes in the present day, such as a tribute to former President George H.W. Bush who died on Nov. 30 or photos of the actual shipyard taken during his Thanksgiving visit home.

When he launched the site, however, he had no idea people from around the world would be so eager to join him.

People whove never heard of the real Portsmouth are learning about it. Fans have asked to purchase the images, so he had to create a company store where he sells mugs. He also sells a calendar on the site.

In March, he printed out the most popular fan images and set up a booth at a comic convention.

He learned about ""diseselpunk"" art, which shares a similar premise to Snipes work, when those artists shared Snipes page.

Each Facebook post makes Snipes believe he wasnt the only one, as he describes it, ""helping to escape the mundane one image at a time.""

""What are your shipping rates to Europe?"" one Facebook follower posted.

""Are you working on a graphic novel?""

""Freaking awesome. Everyone needs to know about this.""

Recently, Snipes received a post that made his life:

""How do I apply at the shipyard?""

Snipes work bends toward the future, but is deeply rooted in his past.

His grandfather worked at the Norfolk Naval Shipyard and he has a nephew who works there now.

The gargantuan Navy ships always captivated him and still do. When he was 10 and 11, hed spend Saturdays at the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard Museum and hoped his friends wouldnt ask on Monday how he spent his weekend.

He didnt want his friends to know he was such a geek, he said.

His Aunt B, Beatrice Elliott, also talked about the war and how she dated a guy who was called to the base after the bombing of Pearl Harbor.

She was also the keeper of thick family albums that he loved going through when they went to her home for Sunday dinners.

""I was captivated by those photographs,"" he said. ""Everybody back in those days were dressed to the nines. All the gents looked distinguished and the women were beautiful. And, at the same time, I knew the people in those photos.""

Years later, it became natural that the past would intertwine with his present. The heroines he draws, the fierce-looking pilots, are modeled after his three daughters.

As the Portsmouth Aeroshipbuilding Co. grows, he wants to build on its past. How could a racially inclusive, gravity-defying entity kind of exist?

Look for storylines with an Abraham Lincoln who was not killed in 1865. The president survived and helped rebuild a country that would be less racially divided than it was after the Civil War.

The 1880s ""War of Currents"" between innovators Thomas Edison and Nikola Tesla will be recast. And theres a possibility that Thomas Andrews, the chief designer of the Titanic, didnt go down with the ship and lived to create something more spectacular.

""This was supposed to be a little project,"" Snipes said of those early days of the yard and how it has changed.

snipes is the ""public information officer"" at the portsmouth aeroshipbuilding co   an alternate universe that resembles the norfolk naval shipyard that snipes grew up near in portsmouth  it can only feel like home  though  at this portsmouth yard  ships are built to fly 

a year ago  snipes created this world in his head and digitally painted it in to play with on facebook 

then other people wanted to play along

portsmouth aeroshipbuilding is what happens when self-proclaimed geeks grow up and their imagination  tools and skills finally fuse and reveal what makes them tick 

snipes works as a digital marketing manager at his bills-paying job 

at night  often pre-dawn  hes dreaming up illustrations  stretching the art skills he learned at i c  norcom high and norfolk state university in the 1980s 

with this  he began by sketching floating tankers  tugboats and navy carriers emerging from clouds  complete with swarms of pesky seagulls  he shrouded them in a historical look with a futuristic feel 

he knew from his job that digital campaigns worked magic for his clients  he wondered if he could use a similar social media approach to create a story 

snipes needed a backstory and realized that the vessels could only be made at a sprawling network of buildings and cranes like the one embedded in his hometown memories 

his aeroshipbuilding enterprise suddenly had a home and a name 

each week  hed develop a craft and slowly reveal its evolution along with the workers who built it  the shipyard is set in the 1940s when the world is at war and america is in dire need of brilliance 

its found at portsmouth where engineers have learned to harness gravity and manipulate moving tons of metal with ""gravitational displacement technology "" or gdt

snipes had to create the theory because of the more than 5 000 viewers who visit his site weekly  several were engineers who had to know  ""how can ships fly ""

snipes said ""i had to have an out ""

he also set the scene in the past because he loved the blooming personality of the 1940s — its jazz-flavored air  the zoot suits and women with back-seamed stockings  it was also a time when america was struggling with a new identity and found it in the rally for the war effort 

""you picture everyday folks that built those big old ships that helped win the war for us; thats amazing "" snipes said  ""as i looked at old photos to get a feel for the story  a lot of those photos were of women who stepped up  this was somebodys mother and grandmother back in the day who worked to make sure were not all speaking german now ""

in his world  most of the top-notch pilots are african american women  occasionally  the famed tuskegee airmen  real african american pilots in wwii  visit aeroshipbuilding to advise on aircraft design 

bessie stringfield  one of the few  if not only  african american motorcycle dispatch riders during world war ii  came by the fictional company to help develop a flying motorcycle called the ""piranha "" its missiles  like those in wwii  include painted warnings to the german leader  adolf hitler 

snipes rakes the internet for historical footage and audio to post  such as ""man-on-the-street"" interviews that reporters had with people in the days following the 1941 attack on pearl harbor  he looks for photos and merges them almost seamlessly with his illustrations 

tony snipes took a historical photograph from the shipyard and added airships and his own image  standing fourth from the right  for his portsmouth aeroshipbuildingcompany series  photographed on friday  nov  23  2018

his facebook page contains actual photos of wartime ship production  but then there are glimpses of snipes in the yard  surveying the sky for stories  or ""sitting"" at a table with singer ella fitzgerald who stopped by to entertain the crowd on a friday 

the facebook page reads like an employee newsletter — no strict plot  no major characters  just snippets of life behind the gates  occasionally  he mixes in the present day  such as a tribute to former president george h w  bush who died on nov  30 or photos of the actual shipyard taken during his thanksgiving visit home 

when he launched the site  however  he had no idea people from around the world would be so eager to join him 

people whove never heard of the real portsmouth are learning about it  fans have asked to purchase the images  so he had to create a company store where he sells mugs  he also sells a calendar on the site 

in march  he printed out the most popular fan images and set up a booth at a comic convention 

he learned about ""diseselpunk"" art  which shares a similar premise to snipes work  when those artists shared snipes page 

each facebook post makes snipes believe he wasnt the only one  as he describes it  ""helping to escape the mundane one image at a time ""

""what are your shipping rates to europe "" one facebook follower posted 

""are you working on a graphic novel ""

""freaking awesome  everyone needs to know about this ""

recently  snipes received a post that made his life

""how do i apply at the shipyard ""

snipes work bends toward the future  but is deeply rooted in his past 

his grandfather worked at the norfolk naval shipyard and he has a nephew who works there now 

the gargantuan navy ships always captivated him and still do  when he was 10 and 11  hed spend saturdays at the portsmouth naval shipyard museum and hoped his friends wouldnt ask on monday how he spent his weekend 

he didnt want his friends to know he was such a geek  he said 

his aunt b  beatrice elliott  also talked about the war and how she dated a guy who was called to the base after the bombing of pearl harbor 

she was also the keeper of thick family albums that he loved going through when they went to her home for sunday dinners 

""i was captivated by those photographs "" he said  ""everybody back in those days were dressed to the nines  all the gents looked distinguished and the women were beautiful  and  at the same time  i knew the people in those photos ""

as the portsmouth aeroshipbuilding co  grows  he wants to build on its past  how could a racially inclusive  gravity-defying entity kind of exist 

look for storylines with an abraham lincoln who was not killed in 1865  the president survived and helped rebuild a country that would be less racially divided than it was after the civil war 

the 1880s ""war of currents"" between innovators thomas edison and nikola tesla will be recast  and theres a possibility that thomas andrews  the chief designer of the titanic  didnt go down with the ship and lived to create something more spectacular

The program, the second in the Chesapeake Forum’s inaugural season, will take place at 7 p.m. March 3, beginning with a musical performance by the Western Branch High School Cammerata, followed by Jemison’s speech.

Jemison’s fame can be measured by her presence in popular culture. She’s appeared on an episode of “Star Trek;” is featured in the children’s book, “Little Leaders: Bold Women in Black History;” and is a figure in the Lego set, “Women of NASA.” She is an inductee into the National Women’s Hall of Fame, the International Space Hall of Fame and the National Medical Association Hall of Fame.

“Her background is varied and fascinating,” Rebecca C.W. Adams, Chesapeake Forum charter member and one of its founders, wrote in an email. “As an engineer, physician and astronaut, she continues to do scientific research about the future of the next 100 years.”

In 1992, as a member of the crew on the space shuttle Endeavor, Jemison became the first woman of color to venture into space. She was also NASA’s first science mission specialist, performing experiments in material science, life sciences and human adaptation to weightlessness.

A Los Angeles physician, she was a Peace Corps officer in Sierra Leone and Liberia. She is also a best-selling author and a noted speaker who travels the country advocating health care, education, social responsibility, motivations and STEM (or science, technology, electronics, mathematics) studies for all.

Sea-arias, organ-ic music
The Chesapeake-based Coastal Virginia Chamber Music (CVCM) will present the musical duo Thalassa in concert at 7 p.m. March 2 at the Great Bridge Methodist Church, 201 Stadium Drive.

The twosome — with Wayla Chambo on flute and Todd Holcombe on guitar — will offer “creative, engaging performances of a variety of repertoire in classical and folk-influenced styles,” according to a press release.

The ensemble is named after Thalassa, the Greek primordial goddess of the sea, who, along with male counterpart Pontos, produced the fish and other sea creatures.

Tickets at the door are $15 for adults and $10 for students and ages 60 and older. CVCM was founded in March 2016 by artistic director Susan Wells with the mission “to inspire, educate and entertain listeners through concerts celebrating the richness and diversity of chamber music performed by artists of the highest caliber for the citizens of Chesapeake and Coastal Virginia, as well as develop a cultural awareness and collaboration with musicians on an international level,” according to CVCM’s website.

A Basquiat full of art
In celebration of Black History Month in February, the Russell Memorial Library, 2808 Taylor Road in Western Branch, invites all youngsters in kindergarten through fifth grades to immerse themselves in the colorful neo-expressionist art world of Jean-Michel Basquiat.

The works and style of Basquiat will be studied during the library’s free Wild Genius Child program from 4-5 p.m. Feb. 24. After being inspired by the New York City artist, youngsters will create their own works in Basquiat’s bold, colorful multimedia style.

Basquiat, the child of a Haitian American father and Puerto Rican mother, is credited with “bringing the African American and Latino experience into the elite art world,” according to biography.com​.

He first gained fame as a graffiti artist under the name SAMO and sold his images and designs on postcards and sweatshirts. Later switching to painting, he became known within the lofty New York City and international art universe for his art that used words, symbols, stick figures and animals as well as for his collaborations with pop artist Andy Warhol.

The session is free and open to all youngsters.

27,"‘Creative Mind’ exhibit at Nauticus celebrates African American contributions in math, engineering, science",the Virginian-Pilot,https://www.pilotonline.com/life/vp-db-the-creative-mind-012022-20220119-vv3rymik2bb7namg3kdxyfzhmm-story.html,Norfolk,01/2022,"A traveling exhibition at Nauticus, “The Creative Mind,” recognizes African Americans in medicine, engineering, mathematics and science. It will be on display through April 2.

The exhibition includes seven panels — each about 8 feet high, 3 feet wide — of portraits and information on more than 50 individuals, including Warren Washington, a scientist who in 1975 created one of the first computer models of the earth’s climate and atmosphere. Another is Shirley Ann Jackson, the first African American woman to receive a doctorate from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, in any field. In 1999, she became the first African American and woman to lead Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in New York, the country’s oldest technological research university. She will leave the post in June.

The exhibit will also include Hampton Roads groundbreakers, including Christine Darden, one of the “human computers” at NASA Langley Research Center in Hampton. In 1967, Darden joined NASA as a mathematician writing programs for engineers. She later became an engineer and led Langley’s Sonic Boom Team. In 2019, Darden received the Congressional Gold Medal for her service to the nation as an aeronautical engineer.

28,Chesapeake artist’s new exhibition reflects ancestral themes,the Virginian-Pilot,https://www.pilotonline.com/entertainment/arts/vp-nk-theresa-brown-0905-20210831-qz3hhdfhvzgphakmmbzk22mj2y-story.html,Norfolk,08/2021,"Chesapeake artist Theresa Brown draws on the hardships and racism her parents endured in rural Virginia when she was a child as the inspiration for her new solo exhibition in Norfolk.

“Racial Inequality: Crossing the Line from Hope to Despair” runs through Oct. 8 at the Offsite Gallery in the MacArthur Center.

Though Brown says her work, with its bold colors and lines, is strikingly modern, it is inspired by her memories of childhood and the hardships her African American ancestors faced in the fields of rural Southampton County. She has vivid memories of her childhood in the 1970s.

“I was raised on a farm in Boykins, Virginia. My parents were farmers. They worked very hard,” she said.

Herbert and Gladys Adkins owned a peanut farm, working long hours to make ends meet.

“As a child, I didn’t really know. I thought it was great because I didn’t have to work, but it was very hard for my parents. They would get up early in the morning to go to the fields, work all day and come home sunset,” she said.

Brown recalls experiencing racism when the family visited Boykins. On a visit to a store, the family was expected to allow a white woman to enter the store first. “The lady came in and my mother told me to stand back, and we had to let her go first,” Brown said.

However, the ancestral theme for the show came to the Hickory-based artist by chance.

“When I started this series, I was trying to figure out what I was going to do. One day I dropped some paint on the floor. I stepped on the paint by mistake,” Brown said. “The paint was red. When I moved, I made a footprint. I said, ‘Wow, this is the answer I needed.’ This whole series has my footprint on it as my signature.”

Brown painted 25 pieces for the exhibition, her first in more than half a decade. Her previous show at the Newsome House Museum & Cultural Center in Newport News featured paintings with a technology theme.

Her new paintings include “The Lines of Hope,” a piece representing “the great future ahead for the black community,” which features bold, bright, deep, rich colors that represent their culture, Brown said.

She completed many of her paintings during the COVID-19 lockdown.

“When I started the series, it was somewhat depressing because I was trying to express the pain my parents went through,” she said.

Then the death of George Floyd at the hands of a police officer in Minnesota brought more heartache for the Black community.

“I have a piece called ‘Why I Cry.’ I used lines and dark colors to express the pain in that piece,” Brown said. “My husband (Victor Brown) told me, ‘You are getting dark; you have to come up and do something about it.’ So I started (going) into a different direction. I started painting happier things.”

Her happier phase included “The Joy of Colors,” a piece featuring deep, intense color. “It brings me joy and peace knowing we have a bright future,” she said.

Brown said there is optimism in the exhibition, reflecting her belief that race relations are improving in America. “It’s got better, but there’s still some work to do.”

Brown has loved abstract art ever since she studied for a Bachelor of Fine Arts degree in commercial art and design at Virginia State University. She worked as an artist in the advertising department of The Virginian-Pilot for more than a decade.

Her work has been displayed at Stockley Garden Art Festival in Norfolk, the Museum of Contemporary Art Boardwalk Art Show in Virginia Beach, The Charles Taylor Visual Arts Center in Hampton and the Williamsburg Contemporary Art Center.

“I’m very excited about this new exhibition. I can’t wait to see it,” she said.","['chesapeake', 'artist', 'theresa', 'brown', 'draws', 'on', 'the', 'hardships', 'and', 'racism', 'her', 'parents', 'endured', 'in', 'rural', 'virginia', 'when',

29,Celebrate Liberty and Freedom with these Juneteenth events,the Virginian-Pilot,https://www.pilotonline.com/entertainment/vp-db-juneteenth-events-061022-20220609-4lw2sngt4jcohg5fq225efw724-story.html,Norfolk,06/2022,"Even though Juneteenth didn’t became a federal holiday until 2021 — and a Virginia holiday in 2020 — Newport News Vice Mayor Saundra Cherry has observed the independence day for years.

Juneteenth celebrates the end of slavery in the United States. It is tied to June 19, 1865 when the Union Army took control of Texas and soldiers arrived in Galveston. They announced that the Civil War had ended in April and that the enslaved were finally free; some 250,000 enslaved African Americans in Texas did not know that the Emancipation Proclamation of 1863 had freed most enslaved in Confederate states two years earlier.

Virginia Beach mass shooting commission asks residents for input about 2019 tragedy
African Americans have commemorated “Emancipation Day” or “Freedom Day” since, and Cherry and her family have observed it as a way to honor the culture and progress of African Americans. The spirit of celebration spread.

“So, we started working on a festival and the city of Newport News has supported the festival for years,” she said.

Newport News and the Downtown Newport News Merchants and Neighbors Association, which Cherry’s late husband started, kicked off a 12-day spread of events on June 8. The first major highlight is a parade on June 11.

“Everything that we do for Juneteenth, we’re trying to bring the community at large together,” she said. “It doesn’t matter about what culture, what race ... It’s about educating the community.”

31,Hampton Roads-based contractor selling NFTs of Confederate monuments he took down,the Virginian-Pilot,https://www.pilotonline.com/virginia/dp-nw-confederate-monument-nfts-20220807-dr6237cnifcx5e7jxmcrv3pwom-story.html,Norfolk,08/2022,"After removing the Robert E. Lee monument in Richmond and nearly two dozen other statues across the city and state, Devon Henry is seeking to raise money for charity by selling digital artwork inspired by their removal in the cryptocurrency market.

CryptoFederacy, Henry’s newest venture, launched its first series of artwork recently with the goal of raising a total of $13 million for various nonprofit groups and social justice causes, including affordable housing development, gun violence prevention, mental health care access and voting rights.

The 45-year-old CEO of Team Henry Enterprises, the Newport News-based contracting firm that the state and cities of Richmond and Charlottesville hired to take down Confederate monuments, said he founded the new company after reflecting on what he should do next after participating in the historical endeavor.

“The statues are down. But what’s next?” Henry said in an interview. “It’s about keeping the momentum going and keeping up the awareness of what those statues have meant — and taking a negative narrative and turning it into something positive.”

Henry said he was apprehensive when the governor’s chief of staff first approached him about removing the Lee monument. He was inclined to take it but considered the fatal white supremacist rally in Charlottesville in 2017 and how a contractor’s car in New Orleans was firebombed.

Henry, who is Black, said he consulted his wife and children. They discussed what it would mean to remove the monuments that generations of people felt had represented oppression and racism and the risks that it might involve.

“We came to the conclusion that we have to do this,” he said. “We have to take these matters in our hand and be courageous in doing so.”

Henry said the goal of CryptoFederacy is to capitalize on the rise of novel technology such as Web3 and non-fungible tokens (NFTs) to raise money for social justice causes.

Founded earlier this year, the organization’s first project is The Thirteen Stars, a collection of digital art that includes 3D models of the Confederate monuments overlaid with newspaper headlines and illustrations of the statues with graffiti surrounding them.

Anthony Bartley, who goes by the artist name Fading Royalty, created most of the artwork for the collection.

Currently based in St. Louis, where he attended Washington University, Bartley, 24, said he was thrilled to participate in the project after curating a book of photography from the 2020 protests. Proceeds of the book sales went toward the NAACP legal defense fund.

Creating the artwork, he said, “brought me back to being in the midst of doing something bigger than myself. And that felt good to be part of it, especially knowing that the proceeds are going to charity.”

The name of the collection is a reference to the 13 stars on the Confederate “Southern Cross” battle flag as well as each of the 13 causes to which CryptoFederacy intends to allocate $1 million with the proceeds from the sale of the artwork.

Michael Garvey, an economist and artist involved in the project, created three pieces for the collection. One of them depicts an alien aircraft “abducting” the statue of Robert E. Lee, while another shows all of the monuments strewn in an arcade claw machine game.

Garvey, 33, said his work is meant to symbolize progressing into “the future” and how the project is intended to claim the monuments.

“It can be like taking some of the oppression ... caused by the culture around the statues and taking money from this NFT project to relieve some of that pressure on us,” he said.

Henry said CryptoFederacy is still engaging potential nonprofit and charitable partners for the project but has already reached agreements with the Richmond-based Better Housing Coalition and the Thurgood Marshall College Fund to support scholarships to historically Black colleges and universities.

Other artists have also sought to raise money from the sale of NFTs recently. For example, Russian feminist art collective and punk rock group Pussy Riot earlier this year helped raise over $7 million in support of Ukraine during the Russian invasion of the country, according to media reports.

Patrons can bid on The Thirteen Stars artwork using the cryptocurrency ethereum. The auction website for the artwork says the minimum bid for each piece is 105 wrapped ether, which is the equivalent of about $182,000.

In addition to acquiring ownership rights to the artwork through the blockchain, a sort of digital public ledger that’s the basis of cryptocurrencies and NFT ownership, buyers will receive a small physical artifact from one of the monuments.

Henry said he chose to embrace the novel cryptocurrency market and new art platform as a way to also encourage Black entrepreneurship in an emerging market.

“I just feel that at some point, it’s going to be a part of our lives,” he said. “I saw a lot of the stuff out there in the NFT space, and I thought this could be something more meaningful and historic that people can get behind and understand.”

Henry said he expects auction for the artwork will remain open online until the end of August. He said CryptoFederacy will also release a second collection of NFT artwork later this summer.","['after', 'removing', 'the', 'robert', 'e', 'lee', 'monument', 'in', 'richmond', 'and', 'nearly',

monument in richmond and nearly two dozen other statues across the city and state  devon henry is seeking to raise money for charity by selling digital artwork inspired by their removal in the cryptocurrency market 

cryptofederacy  henry’s newest venture  launched its first series of artwork recently with the goal of raising a total of $13 million for various nonprofit groups and social justice causes  including affordable housing development  gun violence prevention  mental health care access and voting rights

the 45-year-old ceo of team henry enterprises  the newport news-based contracting firm that the state and cities of richmond and charlottesville hired to take down confederate monuments  said he founded the new company after reflecting on what he should do next after participating in the historical endeavor 

“the statues are down  but what’s next ” henry said in an interview  “it’s about keeping the momentum going and keeping up the awareness of what those statues have meant — and taking a negative narrative and turning it into something positive ”

henry said he was apprehensive when the governor’s chief of staff first approached him about removing the lee monument  he was inclined to take it but considered the fatal white supremacist rally in charlottesville in 2017 and how a contractor’s car in new orleans was firebombed 

henry  who is black  said he consulted his wife and children  they discussed what it would mean to remove the monuments that generations of people felt had represented oppression and racism and the risks that it might involve 

“we came to the conclusion that we have to do this ” he said  “we have to take these matters in our hand and be courageous in doing so ”

henry said the goal of cryptofederacy is to capitalize on the rise of novel technology such as web3 and non-fungible tokens (nfts) to raise money for social justice causes 

founded earlier this year  the organization’s first project is the thirteen stars  a collection of digital art that includes 3d models of the confederate monuments overlaid with newspaper headlines and illustrations of the statues with graffiti surrounding them 

anthony bartley  who goes by the artist name fading royalty  created most of the artwork for the collection

currently based in st  louis  where he attended washington university  bartley  24  said he was thrilled to participate in the project after curating a book of photography from the 2020 protests  proceeds of the book sales went toward the naacp legal defense fund 

creating the artwork  he said  “brought me back to being in the midst of doing something bigger than myself  and that felt good to be part of it  especially knowing that the proceeds are going to charity ”

the name of the collection is a reference to the 13 stars on the confederate “southern cross” battle flag as well as each of the 13 causes to which cryptofederacy intends to allocate $1 million with the proceeds from the sale of the artwork 

michael garvey  an economist and artist involved in the project  created three pieces for the collection  one of them depicts an alien aircraft “abducting” the statue of robert e  lee  while another shows all of the monuments strewn in an arcade claw machine game 

garvey  33  said his work is meant to symbolize progressing into “the future” and how the project is intended to claim the monuments 

“it can be like taking some of the oppression     caused by the culture around the statues and taking money from this nft project to relieve some of that pressure on us ” he said 

henry said cryptofederacy is still engaging potential nonprofit and charitable partners for the project but has already reached agreements with the richmond-based better housing coalition and the thurgood marshall college fund to support scholarships to historically black colleges and universities 

other artists have also sought to raise money from the sale of nfts recently  for example  russian feminist art collective and punk rock group pussy riot earlier this year helped raise over $7 million in support of ukraine during the russian invasion of the country  according to media reports 

patrons can bid on the thirteen stars artwork using the cryptocurrency ethereum  the auction website for the artwork says the minimum bid for each piece is 105 wrapped ether  which is the equivalent of about $182 000 

in addition to acquiring ownership rights to the artwork through the blockchain  a sort of digital public ledger that’s the basis of cryptocurrencies and nft ownership  buyers will receive a small physical artifact from one of the monuments 

henry said he chose to embrace the novel cryptocurrency market and new art platform as a way to also encourage black entrepreneurship in an emerging market 

“i just feel that at some point  it’s going to be a part of our lives ” he said  “i saw a lot of the stuff out there in the nft space  and i thought this could be something more meaningful and historic that people can get behind and understand ”

henry said he expects auction for the artwork will remain open online until the end of august  he said cryptofederacy will also release a second collection of nft artwork later this summer ","['ate', 'be ', 'black', 'cap', 'cat', 'che', 'culture', 'dis', 'hip', 'ice ', 'ion', 'ipa', 'justice', 'laid ', 'lit', 'mean ', 'n', 'naacp', 'nd', 'oppression', 'paper ', 'race', 'racism', 'rap', 'read', 'sis', 'social justice', 'tea', 'tho', 'token', 'tuff', '', '', '', '', '', '']",34,16,37,954

It’s some advice Denae Horton got from her son’s teachers after the coronavirus pandemic closed the doors to their school, Thurgood Marshall Elementary in Chesapeake. Horton had been feeling down. She was worried she wasn’t being the mother her two boys needed. She was preoccupied not only by what impacts the pandemic was having on her own job prospects, but about their education.

On top of all that were money concerns. She was ready to sell some items in the house so she could get them a computer to keep up with virtual learning. The internet bill was more expensive now because they needed faster speeds to allow all their devices to connect and run smoothly. Her grandfather is helping split the bill after she shut the internet off for a brief period this summer. Horton had to worry about child care, too. The office administrative assistant position she was counting on after graduating in March from an intensive six-month job training program seemingly vanished because of the pandemic. She works as a nursing assistant and plans to be home with her boys to start the school year, but also needs to keep up hours.

Instead of getting angry about how the school year ended, she listened to the teachers’ advice.

One book a day and cuddle.

Since March, Chesapeake and other Hampton Roads school districts have been focused on helping families like Horton’s by addressing what has become a crucial part of learning in a pandemic: technology and access.

Schools are spending millions of dollars for upgraded equipment. Thousands of laptops. Overhauling WiFi infrastructure. Building internet hotspots dubbed “wireless on wheels” to park around town.

With just three weeks to go before virtual class is in session, schools say they are getting ready. Surveys have helped identify how many families are in need of devices and access to the internet. Horton said she filled out a survey indicating she was in need of computers so her oldest boy, Delon, who will be in the fifth grade, can get his work done. Her youngest, Lee’Ontae, will need one, too, as he heads into the third grade.

“Some way,” Horton said, “we will get through this.”

Closing the gaps
Technology will play a key role in connecting students and giving them a chance to succeed in the classroom and beyond, but districts need to be agile in addressing disparities in access to technology and the internet, said Nicol Turner Lee, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institute in Washington. She studies digital divides in education. Turner Lee pointed to a Common Sense Media report that found 9 million of the 50 million K-12 public school students who have had to learn remotely from home because of COVID closures lacked adequate internet and devices. These sorts of gaps are more pronounced for Black, Hispanic and lower-income households, according to the Pew Research Center.

“It’s important for us to sort of think through how do we resolve those types of issues for families that have to choose between broadband and bread,” Turner Lee said.

Across Virginia, the majority of public school divisions indicated that 20% or more students don’t have access to internet at home, according to the state Department of Education. That’s largely an issue with more rural districts, but includes some families in Hampton Roads who have low incomes or live in less populated parts of cities including Virginia Beach and Chesapeake.

There has been help for school districts in Hampton Roads. Federal funding through the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act has given some cash-strapped districts a chance to afford these big technology orders. The federal funds have helped fast track plans to outfit most students with laptops.

“That’s the silver lining for COVID,” said Michael Cataldo, chief information and instructional technology officer for Norfolk Public Schools. “Additional funding to really truly be able to support instruction in a more unique and innovative way that many have wanted to do for a while but the funds and the direction wasn’t really needed as much. Now, COVID really put everything on fast forward.”

To that end, Norfolk Public Schools has been contacting parents to find out how many laptops families need and expects to get totals in the next week. Cataldo says they have enough devices on hand to address those needs. In addition, the district expects in the next two weeks to receive an order of over 10,000 Chromebooks that would help Norfolk become “one-to-one,” meaning each of their students would have a device.

That order was placed around April or May, Cataldo said, but issues in the supply chain, caused in part due to the pandemic, delayed it to at least the third week of August.

In Chesapeake, Jeff Faust, the school division’s executive director of technology, said they’ve run into similar delivery delays. The district is waiting on an order of 17,000 Chromebooks. The $3.6 million order was placed in May and Chesapeake was initially told the order wouldn’t come until as late as November. Faust said he pushed vendors and called them every day and they now expect to receive the laptops as soon as mid-August and as late as the second or third week of September.

Faust said the order would not have been possible without $6.3 million in CARES Act money. Chesapeake’s City Council also recently allocated $1.8 million of the city’s CARES Act funds to the school district for technology needs. The community has helped, too: Mount Lebanon Baptist Church donated $30,000 to go toward purchasing tablets for 360 children across seven elementary and primary schools.

The Chromebooks will help the district get to one-to-one. Students across nine of Chesapeake’s 45 buildings have Chromebooks already, Faust said.

Moving toward the future
The federal government sent $238.6 million to public schools in Virginia as part of the CARES Act. Hampton Roads received roughly 22% of that chunk, and technology expenditures appear to be at the top of the list for some schools.

Virginia Beach has plans to set aside $2.6 million for upgrades to teacher laptops and spend more to improve WiFi in outdoor areas. The laptops haven’t been ordered yet because of availability, a school spokeswoman said, but they’re working with a vendor to determine which models to order and hope to have them available before November.

Hampton City Schools plans $3.8 million in spending on technology, including expanding access to Chromebooks for students in grades kindergarten through fourth. In Newport News, all students will get a Chromebook for the upcoming school year, a school spokeswoman wrote in an email to The Virginian-Pilot. The majority of those purchases were made between March and July using $1 million in CARES Act funds. High schoolers got their Chromebooks earlier this month and middle schoolers were getting theirs this week. New Chromebooks for elementary students might not arrive until December, a spokeswoman said, but the district planned to distribute devices to those who need them in the interim.

The pandemic also has meant empty buildings, allowing at least one district to get work done quicker.

Since Chesapeake schools closed in March, Faust said, they’ve overhauled network infrastructure inside all the buildings, which will help improve WiFi for those teachers required to lead their virtual classes from the school building. Some teachers have told The Pilot that certain schools, such as Oscar Smith High, have poor internet connections, leading to delays in lessons.

The district also has ordered 2,000 WiFi hotspots that will be distributed for free to families who don’t have internet at home. Faust said they can get more if needed. The district will also be placing five “wireless on wheels” trailers around the city. The trailers provide a free internet connection and will be parked in public locations so anyone can connect a device to it. The technology being adopted now will change schools for good, Cataldo said. For one, districts can use less paper if more students and staff have reliable devices. Instruction can be more on a student’s schedule and parents can be a part of their learning. Making up missed classes after snow days could be a thing of the past because everyone has a computer.

“That’s the future,” Cataldo said. “That’s where we need to move to.”","['one', 'book', 'a', 'day', 'and', 'cuddle', 'it’s', 'some', 'advice', 'denae', 'horton', 'got', 'from', 'her', 'son’s',

it’s some advice denae horton got from her son’s teachers after the coronavirus pandemic closed the doors to their school  thurgood marshall elementary in chesapeake  horton had been feeling down  she was worried she wasn’t being the mother her two boys needed  she was preoccupied not only by what impacts the pandemic was having on her own job prospects  but about their education 

on top of all that were money concerns  she was ready to sell some items in the house so she could get them a computer to keep up with virtual learning  the internet bill was more expensive now because they needed faster speeds to allow all their devices to connect and run smoothly  her grandfather is helping split the bill after she shut the internet off for a brief period this summer  horton had to worry about child care  too  the office administrative assistant position she was counting on after graduating in march from an intensive six-month job training program seemingly vanished because of the pandemic  she works as a nursing assistant and plans to be home with her boys to start the school year  but also needs to keep up hours 

instead of getting angry about how the school year ended  she listened to the teachers’ advice 

one book a day and cuddle 

since march  chesapeake and other hampton roads school districts have been focused on helping families like horton’s by addressing what has become a crucial part of learning in a pandemic technology and access 

schools are spending millions of dollars for upgraded equipment  thousands of laptops  overhauling wifi infrastructure  building internet hotspots dubbed “wireless on wheels” to park around town 

with just three weeks to go before virtual class is in session  schools say they are getting ready  surveys have helped identify how many families are in need of devices and access to the internet  horton said she filled out a survey indicating she was in need of computers so her oldest boy  delon  who will be in the fifth grade  can get his work done  her youngest  lee’ontae  will need one  too  as he heads into the third grade 

“some way ” horton said  “we will get through this ”

closing the gaps
technology will play a key role in connecting students and giving them a chance to succeed in the classroom and beyond  but districts need to be agile in addressing disparities in access to technology and the internet  said nicol turner lee  a senior fellow at the brookings institute in washington  she studies digital divides in education  turner lee pointed to a common sense media report that found 9 million of the 50 million k-12 public school students who have had to learn remotely from home because of covid closures lacked adequate internet and devices  these sorts of gaps are more pronounced for black  hispanic and lower-income households  according to the pew research center 

“it’s important for us to sort of think through how do we resolve those types of issues for families that have to choose between broadband and bread ” turner lee said 

across virginia  the majority of public school divisions indicated that 20% or more students don’t have access to internet at home  according to the state department of education  that’s largely an issue with more rural districts  but includes some families in hampton roads who have low incomes or live in less populated parts of cities including virginia beach and chesapeake 

there has been help for school districts in hampton roads  federal funding through the coronavirus aid  relief  and economic security act has given some cash-strapped districts a chance to afford these big technology orders  the federal funds have helped fast track plans to outfit most students with laptops 

“that’s the silver lining for covid ” said michael cataldo  chief information and instructional technology officer for norfolk public schools  “additional funding to really truly be able to support instruction in a more unique and innovative way that many have wanted to do for a while but the funds and the direction wasn’t really needed as much  now  covid really put everything on fast forward ”

to that end  norfolk public schools has been contacting parents to find out how many laptops families need and expects to get totals in the next week  cataldo says they have enough devices on hand to address those needs  in addition  the district expects in the next two weeks to receive an order of over 10 000 chromebooks that would help norfolk become “one-to-one ” meaning each of their students would have a device 

that order was placed around april or may  cataldo said  but issues in the supply chain  caused in part due to the pandemic  delayed it to at least the third week of august 

in chesapeake  jeff faust  the school division’s executive director of technology  said they’ve run into similar delivery delays  the district is waiting on an order of 17 000 chromebooks  the $3 6 million order was placed in may and chesapeake was initially told the order wouldn’t come until as late as november  faust said he pushed vendors and called them every day and they now expect to receive the laptops as soon as mid-august and as late as the second or third week of september 

faust said the order would not have been possible without $6 3 million in cares act money  chesapeake’s city council also recently allocated $1 8 million of the city’s cares act funds to the school district for technology needs  the community has helped  too mount lebanon baptist church donated $30 000 to go toward purchasing tablets for 360 children across seven elementary and primary schools 

the chromebooks will help the district get to one-to-one  students across nine of chesapeake’s 45 buildings have chromebooks already  faust said 

moving toward the future
the federal government sent $238 6 million to public schools in virginia as part of the cares act  hampton roads received roughly 22% of that chunk  and technology expenditures appear to be at the top of the list for some schools 

virginia beach has plans to set aside $2 6 million for upgrades to teacher laptops and spend more to improve wifi in outdoor areas  the laptops haven’t been ordered yet because of availability  a school spokeswoman said  but they’re working with a vendor to determine which models to order and hope to have them available before november 

hampton city schools plans $3 8 million in spending on technology  including expanding access to chromebooks for students in grades kindergarten through fourth  in newport news  all students will get a chromebook for the upcoming school year  a school spokeswoman wrote in an email to the virginian-pilot  the majority of those purchases were made between march and july using $1 million in cares act funds  high schoolers got their chromebooks earlier this month and middle schoolers were getting theirs this week  new chromebooks for elementary students might not arrive until december  a spokeswoman said  but the district planned to distribute devices to those who need them in the interim 

the pandemic also has meant empty buildings  allowing at least one district to get work done quicker 

since chesapeake schools closed in march  faust said  they’ve overhauled network infrastructure inside all the buildings  which will help improve wifi for those teachers required to lead their virtual classes from the school building  some teachers have told the pilot that certain schools  such as oscar smith high  have poor internet connections  leading to delays in lessons 

the district also has ordered 2 000 wifi hotspots that will be distributed for free to families who don’t have internet at home  faust said they can get more if needed  the district will also be placing five “wireless on wheels” trailers around the city  the trailers provide a free internet connection and will be parked in public locations so anyone can connect a device to it  the technology being adopted now will change schools for good  cataldo said  for one  districts can use less paper if more students and staff have reliable devices  instruction can be more on a student’s schedule and parents can be a part of their learning  making up missed classes after snow days could be a thing of the past because everyone has a computer 

“that’s the future ” cataldo said  “that’s where we need to move to ”","['ate', 'be ', 'been', 'black', 'cat', 'che', 'class', 'dis', 'done ', 'fam', 'hang', 'ice ', 'ion', 'lit', 'n', 'nd', 'paper ', 'period', 'rack', 'rap', 'read', 'school', 'sis', 'tea', 'tho', 'unity ', 'yo', '', '', '', '', '', '']",47,23,33,1401
33,The duo Black Violin is bringing its mix of classical and hip-hop music to Norfolk on Sunday,the Virginian-Pilot,https://www.pilotonline.com/entertainment/music/vp-db-black-violin-021822-20220217-flfnbqrizzbdxaijyuqdek6h4e-story.html,Norfolk,02/2022,"Any music act with a unique sound — such as Black Violin’s fusion of classical and hip-hop — is bound to sound familiar from album to album.

But violinist Kev Marcus sees a definite difference between its current album, “Take The Stairs,” and the previous two he made as half of the Black Violin duo. The album also earned Marcus and violist-keyboardist-singer Wil Baptiste their first Grammy Award nomination in 2020.

“This is the most authentic album we’ve ever done,” he said in a phone interview. “The album is who we are. That was the best part of it. It didn’t feel like we had to try to conform or act like anything else, and we were still able to make an album that we feel very, very proud about without necessarily compromising our ideas in any way — all without being preachy.” Marcus feels three songs from “Take The Stairs” lean decidedly classical, three others —“Rise,” “Serenade” and “Nimrod” —represent new twists in the way he and Baptiste write music. Most of the other songs demonstrate the duo’s ability to blend hip-hop, classical instrumentation and melody in fairly equal measures. For instance, “One Step” starts out with a sonic blast that’s almost industrial before layering in beats and an R&B-leaning vocal melody sung by Baptiste, who has grown into a quite capable singer. “Lost in the Garden” has a bit of Marvin Gaye in its soulful sound, while “Spaz,” “Showoff” and “Dreamer” are good examples of the melding the duo is known for.

This musical hybrid is something Marcus and Baptiste began forming in high school when Marcus had an idea for how to incorporate violin into the Busta Rhymes 1998 song “Gimme Some More.”

That idea, however, was put on hold when, in 2004, Marcus and Baptiste won the Showtime at the Apollo talent competition and were introduced to the manager of songwriter and singer Alicia Keys. They were hired to join her band for a performance during the 2004 Billboard Music Awards.

This led to opportunities to tour, not only with Keys but Jay-Z, Kanye West and rock band Linkin Park. But the duo never lost sight of creating their own music and decided to stop taking touring.

The self-titled debut arrived in 2008, followed in 2012 by “Classically Trained” and ‘Stereotypes” in 2015. Black Violin has had songs used in commercials, television and movies, and has created its own foundation, which encourages kids to pursue music or other careers they are passionate about. That message is woven through several songs on “Take The Stairs,” which was released in late 2019.
With concert venues reopening, Marcus and Baptiste have returned to the road, bringing along drummer Nat Stokes and DJ SPS, both longtime touring members, to create a unique experience.

“It’s more dynamic than the show has ever been because of the album,” Marcus said. “Of course, we tell kids to dream, tell people to dream, the impossible is possible, just run through walls for whatever you’re passionate about. All of the messaging of the album is pretty much there” in the show.

It will be on display through April 2. The traveling show was launched in 2012 by the African American History Program of the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine in Washington, D.C. and has been on display in libraries, community centers and universities around the country. Biographies of select African American doctors, scientists and engineers can be found at africanamericanhistoryprogram.org.

The exhibition is free for Nauticus members. General admission, $15.95 for adults and $11.95 for children, includes access to STEM programs and activities.

Nauticus is open from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. Tuesday to Saturday; noon to 5 p.m. Sunday.

Visit nauticus.org or call (757) 664-1000 for more information.

The exhibition includes seven panels — each about 8 feet high, 3 feet wide — of portraits and information on more than 50 individuals, including Warren Washington, a scientist who in 1975 created one of the first computer models of the earth’s climate and atmosphere. Another is Shirley Ann Jackson, the first African American woman to receive a doctorate from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, in any field. In 1999, she became the first African American and woman to lead Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in New York, the country’s oldest technological research university. She will leave the post in June.

The exhibition Beyond the Block will open at each venue on November 16.  It will close at the Peninsula Fine Arts Center on Jan. 5, 2020. Works will be on view at the Chrysler Museum of Art and Virginia MOCA through Feb. 9, 2020. 


The museums will feature works that were created using jail-safe pens, food, deodorant, and other materials that are allowed in correctional facilities.

“Finding opportunities for inmates to be creative with their time is important,” said Norfolk Sheriff Joe Baron. “When they are given those opportunities with art programs, it can be very meaningful. There is some pretty amazing talent discovered, and then it’s rewarded with positive feedback. The lesson is to lead a productive and creative life and steer away from destructive behaviors which tend to lead them to incarceration.”

Beyond the Block is named for inmate housing units – called blocks – and the notion that the exhibition focuses on life outside of jail. The exhibition debuted at the Chrysler Museum in 2017 with work from inmates at the Virginia Beach Correctional Center.

The rainbow mural is also outlined in black and brown to honor the Black Lives Matter movement. 

Jacki Paolella was one of the artists that helped create the mural. 


""We all came out here Sunday morning and painted the sidewalk,"" Paolella said. ""Even some people that were wandering by stopped and helped. It didnt take long, as we finished pretty quickly with the ten of us!""

The artists said the hanging Pride flag above the Naro Cinema has been taken down several times, so this was a way to permanently lay down the colors of the flag on cement. The idea was sparked by artists Christopher Revels and Jessica Jackman.

""Were tired of the hatred coming and we want to show the community that we are here and not going anywhere,"" Revels said. ""You cant steal this, you cant steal the love that we put on the ground.""

Inmates from Norfolk, Virginia Beach and the Hampton Roads Regional Jail will submit pieces. Barbara Johnson created a drawing titled “Addiction: One Eye Open, One Eye Closed.” It starts out with a blood-stained set of eyes etched in paper, but ends with bright colors and both eyes opened. ""This is how I felt when I was addicted,” Johnson pointed out. “This is how I feel now. Now both eyes are open."" Lori Coupland created a 3D art piece that chronicles her time battling addiction as well. She was admitted to the jail on a probation violation. Her piece starts out dark, but ends with hope. ""It's about abuse. It's about being incarcerated for most of my adult life,"" Coupland said. ""But I still have a lot of fight in me."" Their pieces join about a dozen others that are vying for a spot at the Chrysler Museum of Art’s special exhibit “Beyond the Block.” It’s showing from Nov. 6 to Jan. 13. While some pieces might not make the cut, inmates say the process has been therapeutic and they hope their illustrations speak to others. ""God's got a purpose for my life.

Of the seven cities, Norfolk far outpaces the others in total spending.

Between January 2013 and September 2014, the city spent more than $500,000 on public art.

41,Hampton's Barrel Art has jobs ready for people affected by shutdown,13NewsNow,https://www.13newsnow.com/article/news/hamptons-barrel-art-has-jobs-ready-for-people-affected-by-shutdown/291-3b5a32f1-875e-44b8-99a3-b64bb09c04c7,Norfolk,01/2019,"HAMPTON, Va. — Barrel Art owner Mike Prieto is looking for workers, and he wants to offer woodworking or metalworking jobs to people impacted by the government shutdown.

Even with the temporary lift of the shutdown, Prieto said he knows some families are still searching for work or an extra paycheck.

Prieto said he'd like to hire full-time workers but he's willing to bring in part-time help to finish multiple projects. 

He said the hours can be flexible and experience would be a boost, but it's not required. Prieto said he can train anyone who's interested in the work and will pay $10 an hour or more based on experience.

Barrel Art is a company that uses reclaimed red wine barrels to make unique home decor and furniture. Prieto and his team craft tables, chairs, benches, cabinets, flights, art, decorations, and a variety of other products.

At Barrel Art, new employee Kenny Stevens said he never thought he'd be using his skills from woodshop class, but he's loving the work.

""When you're doing something positive instead of something negative it's always a good thing to do,"" Stevens said. ""We can always use an extra hand around here, it helps get all this great work done.""

Another employee, Sarah Roach, said she used to work in a pharmacy but now she treasures working with her hands and seeing tangible results.

""I'll take this any day,"" said Roach. ""Honestly it's made my quality of life so much better to love a job.""

Prieto was originally trying to find furloughed workers in need of work, but he's looking for anyone who might need the job and money. 

He said he's been inspired by the generosity of his community during the government shutdown.

Prieto said it represents how a military community is always there to help out, and he's hoping that he can hire new employees and help them in a time of need.

If you're interested in learning more about the job openings, you can email Prieto at mike@barrel-art.com or call 757-639-5771.

""We tried to keep it for the culture, pay it back to the culture to uplifting the culture,"" said Cheria Brickhouse, one of the Homage Hall owners. ""That's really what it's all about. Like, if we're not going to support ourselves and uplift us, who will?""


Nine creatives started the business. It's a project they say took months of construction to bring to life.

""We had to experience it first before we opened the doors and let everyone else experience it,"" said co-owner Stefon Penn. ""So there were many flaws, many things that we fixed, changed.""


They just opened the exhibit over the weekend. They say it's more than a selfie museum but an educational experience.

""You learn about the music industry,"" said co-owner Raven Revell. ""In the HBCU room, educational room, you learn about the Black authors that are from the area. You learn about HBCUs.""

It's also a conversation starter on issues like Black hair and police brutality.

""So we want that to be a conversation, people be able to come in here have that conversation and be positive about it at the same time,"" co-owner Jermesha Williams said.

The exhibit, located inside Military Circle Mall, is a place where they all hung out as kids. They say it's the best spot for the exhibit.

""Initially we decided to settle on Military Circle because there was that nostalgic feeling when we walked into the mall,"" co-owner Travis Brickhouse said.

They hope the exhibit will bring more customers to the mall as they pay homage to those who paved the way.

Big changes are coming to the Muscarelle Museum of Art on the campus of William & Mary. University officials released a new rendering of its multimillion-dollar expansion project. David Brashear, the museum director, will be sharing the details of the design and discussing the project dates for the expansion. An information session will take place Tuesday at 6 p.m in the museum’s Sheridan Gallery. Officials said the expansion is expected to break ground by the end of 2022. It was designed by Pelli Clarke and Partner, an architecture firm based in Connecticut and New York. This new project is being done in an effort to give students the opportunity to use the museum as a laboratory to learn. “We will have a central atrium that runs along an axis between the existing building and the new wing. The atrium will be our new entrance, and will allow access from both the Jamestown Road side of the museum and the campus side near Jones Hall,” Brashear said. According to Brashear, the new facility is expected to open in 2024, as part of the 40th-anniversary celebration of when the original facility opened.

44,Inside Out' portrait installation coming to Hampton Roads and they need your photos,13NewsNow,https://www.13newsnow.com/article/news/national/military-news/inside-out-portrait-installation-coming-to-hampton-roads-and-they-need-your-photos/291-0e0680ce-c204-4d18-bab3-8e7e7850d1e6,Norfolk,02/2020,"VIRGINIA BEACH, Va. — A major, portrait installation is coming to Hampton Roads and the group responsible wants your picture to be a part of it. It’s called the Inside Out project. It’s a series of portraits from happy to funny to serious. It was founded in 2011 by a French street artist and has grown worldwide. “It’s a fascinating, worldwide, one of a kind, global art project,” group leader Bobby Levin said. “There have been approximately 1,800 installations in 142 countries around the world.” This is the first time it’s coming to Hampton roads – and they need models. Levin is set up at Haynes Furniture in Virginia Beach ready to snap your picture. You can get your picture taken Saturday and Monday from 9 a.m. to noon, or Sunday from 10 a.m. to noon. For this version of the project, Levin wants to capture portraits of military members and their families to pay tribute to the sacrifices they make. “When women and men are deployed, I believe there’s one very solid brotherhood or sisterhood, and they bond. But those that are left here I would say are equally as courageous,” he said. ""Mothers, fathers, sisters, brothers, children, grandparents – come and have your picture taken and express yourself.” The move-poster-sized portraits will be installed on the wall outside Haynes in April.","['virginia', 'beach', 'va', '—', 'a', 'major', 'portrait', 'installation', 'is', 'coming', 'to', 'hampton', 'roads', 'and', 'the', 'group', 'responsible', 'wants', 'your', 'picture', 'to', 'be', 'a', 'part', 'of', 'it', 'it’s', 'called', 'the', 'inside', 'out', 'project', 'it’s', 'a', 'series', 'of', 'portraits', 'from', 'happy', 'to', 'funny', 'to', 'serious', 'it', 'was', 'founded', 'in', '2011', 'by', 'a', 'french', 'street', 'artist', 'and', 'has', 'grown', 'worldwide', '“it’s', 'a', 'fascinating', 'worldwide', 'one', 'of', 'a', 'kind', 'global', 'art', 'project', '”', 'group', 'leader', 'bobby', 'levin', 'said', '“there', 'have', 'been', 'approximately', '1', '800', 'installations', 'in', '142', 'countries', 'around', 'the', 'world', '”', 'this', 'is', 'the', 'first', 'time', 'it’s', 'coming', 'to', 'hampton', 'roads', '–', 'and', 'they', 'need', 'models', 'levin', 'is', 'set', 'up', 'at', 'haynes', 'furniture', 'in', 'virginia', 'beach', 'ready', 'to', 'snap', 'your', 'picture', 'you', 'can', 'get', 'your', 'picture', 'taken', 'saturday', 'and', 'monday', 'from', '9', 'a', 'm', 'to', 'noon', 'or', 'sunday', 'from', '10', 'a', 'm', 'to', 'noon', 'for', 'this', 'version', 'of', 'the', 'project', 'levin', 'wants', 'to', 'capture', 'portraits', 'of', 'military', 'members', 'and', 'their', 'families', 'to', 'pay', 'tribute', 'to', 'the', 'sacrifices', 'they', 'make', '“when', 'women', 'and', 'men', 'are', 'deployed', 'i', 'believe', 'there’s', 'one', 'very', 'solid', 'brotherhood', 'or', 'sisterhood', 'and', 'they', 'bond', 'but', 'those', 'that', 'are', 'left', 'here', 'i', 'would', 'say', 'are', 'equally', 'as', 'courageous', '”', 'he', 'said', '""mothers', 'fathers', 'sisters', 'brothers', 'children', 'grandparents', '–', 'come', 'and', 'have', 'your', 'picture', 'taken', 'and', 'express', 'yourself', '”', 'the', 'move-poster-sized', 'portraits', 'will', 'be', 'installed', 'on', 'the', 'wall', 'outside', 'haynes', 'in', 'april']","['responsible', 'happy', 'funny', 'fascinating', 'kind', 'ready', 'tribute', 'solid', 'courageous', 'will']","['serious', 'need']",2.0,2020.0,"virginia beach  va  — a major  portrait installation is coming to hampton roads and the group responsible wants your picture to be a part of it  it’s called the inside out project  it’s a series of portraits from happy to funny to serious  it was founded in 2011 by a french street artist and has grown worldwide  “it’s a fascinating  worldwide  one of a kind  global art project ” group leader bobby levin said  “there have been approximately 1 800 installations in 142 countries around the world ” this is the first time it’s coming to hampton roads – and they need models  levin is set up at haynes furniture in virginia beach ready to snap your picture  you can get your picture taken saturday and monday from 9 a m  to noon  or sunday from 10 a m  to noon  for this version of the project  levin wants to capture portraits of military members and their families to pay tribute to the sacrifices they make  “when women and men are deployed  i believe there’s one very solid brotherhood or sisterhood  and they bond  but those that are left here i would say are equally as courageous ” he said  ""mothers  fathers  sisters  brothers  children  grandparents – come and have your picture taken and express yourself ” the move-poster-sized portraits will be installed on the wall outside haynes in april ","['ate', 'be ', 'been', 'cap', 'fam', 'hood', 'ion', 'lit', 'n', 'nd', 'read', 'sis', 'tho', 'yo', '', '', '', '', '', '']",10,2,20,230

Ciara Mitchell, also 16, is an aspiring engineer and actress. The girls have different ambitions, but they were brought together by a common passion.

Dr. Williamson was a part of the dance line in 2000. ""We were able to develop sisterhood,"" said Dr. Williamson. ""And what we have been able to do is bond throughout the years.""

47,Eastern Shore artist honored as Living Legend,13NewsNow,https://www.13newsnow.com/article/entertainment/arts/eastern-shore-artist-honored-as-living-legend/291-481048413,Norfolk,10/2017,"MELFA, Va. (Delmarva Now) -- Eastern Shore artist David Turner has been creating sculptures of wildlife since he was 6 years old. Fifty years later, he is the recipient of the Ward Museum of Wildfowl Art’s Living Legend Award for his lifelike bronze works. “I’m totally passionate about being able to work with the clay,” Turner said, adding, “I’m very appreciative and honored to have received the award.” Growing up in a household with William H. Turner, his father and co-owner of Turner Sculpture foundry and studio in Melfa, Turner took up sculpting from an early age. “My father was in dental school when he was 30 and had three kids, and was making ceramic wildlife figurines to help pay his way through dental school,” the artist said. “I pored through nature books. I love looking at nature books and looking at photos (of wildlife), and I love nature shows,” Turner said. “I was crazy about birds in particular,” he added. He continued sculpting throughout high school, and then left the Eastern Shore to earn a degree in biology, with a minor in studio art, from the College of William and Mary in 1983. With plans to go into wildlife management, Turner intended to pursue art as a hobby, but he found a unique way to marry the two. Turner has called his Melfa studio home since 1983 and, along with his father, has created more than 170 publicly commissioned wildlife sculptures for locations from Washington’s National Zoo to the Route 50 entrance to Ocean City. Some of his local works include the blue heron and Canadian geese statues at Norfolk's MacArthur Center, as well as the ""Trio of Herons Fountain"" centerpiece of Virginia Beach Town Center. See Also: List of David Turner's public commissions He uses the lost-wax process to create his three-dimensional works. The intensive process begins with a clay model, which can take anywhere from a few weeks to a year-and-a-half to create, depending on its size, Turner said. Once the model is complete, he encases in it in a rubber mold and then cuts that mold from the clay. He then pours wax into the empty space to create a wax casting, which he corrects for imperfections before dipping into a ceramic liquid. After building up several ceramic layers, the piece is ready to be fired in the furnace, which hardens the mold and evacuates the wax — lending the technique its “lost wax” name. Finally, Turner pours molten bronze into the ceramic mold, lets it cool and chisels the ceramic material from the bronze surface. “We’re a foundry, studio and gallery. … We do everything right here from the beginning to the end,” Turner said, which is “fairly unique” in his line of work.","['melfa', 'va', '(delmarva', 'now)', '--', 'eastern', 'shore', 'artist', 'david', 'turner', 'has', 'been',

They're rather simple, yet stunning. The artists, like William Overton, didn't have much to work with to make them. And that wasn't by choice, per se. They're inmates. The crowd of law enforcement officers in uniform drawn to the exhibit sheds a light on who is behind the work, because the artists themselves, are absent. Overton, like many of the others, is still in jail. ""William will hopefully be able to actually come and experience it once he's free and see his work in the context of all these other works,"" Rasputin said. ""I make art mostly for myself. Because it's therapeutic, I enjoy it, and I'm kind of good at it,"" Overton, 39, said during an interview at the jail Friday. His passion started long before coming to the Chesapeake Jail and he plans to pursue it on the outside. ""I think that getting... that having success outside my circle of that I'm already related to and close to would definitely be an encouragement and a motivator to keep me from going back to poor decision making,"" he said. ""I think it's often easy...to create something out of your imagination,"" Rasputin said, who received a letter from Overton expressing his interest in art, ""But it's not that easy to create that hope that we need to keep ourselves moving forward.""

(Delmarva Now) — Mary ""Mama Girl"" Onley, the beloved Eastern Shore of Virginia folk artist, died Saturday after an illness. Onley, 64, of Painter, was known for her papier-mache sculptures and colorful paintings. Her works are in many private collections, in addition to a permanent collection at the American Visionary Arts Museum in Baltimore. As news of her death spread, art lovers began posting photographs of her works with messages of remembrance on social media, including on her professional Facebook page, Mama-Girl FolkArt. Onley started making her distinctive style of art more than a quarter-century ago, after a series of seizures and a diagnosis of severe allergies caused her to stop working in the fields of the Eastern Shore — she had done fieldwork for more than 22 years before that, since the age of 12, according to a 2016 article in the Eastern Shore News. Looking for a new vocation, Onley began experimenting with a variant of papier-mache using strips of newspaper, Elmer's glue and acrylic paint. Onley, who also was a pastor, said she called for guidance on the Spirit — the voice of God that would speak to her when she began working on a new piece of art. ""I said good Lord, give me something nobody's never done. Show me how to work this newspaper and glue,"" she said. ""The Spirit showed me how to work the newspaper and glue and I started right from there, you know."" Onley created her art in her home studio on a back road in Painter. She became well-known in the folk art community, often traveling to festivals and teaching classes. Speaking about Onley's art, ""It has a soul to it,"" said Hampton Roads, Virginia, artist and restaurateur Sydney Meers in an episode of Curate757 that aired earlier this year on PBS. Onley's grandson, Malcolm White, in February presented two American flag pins she had made to Gov. Ralph Northam and his wife at a gala in Onancock, during Northam's first official visit to the Eastern Shore after he was elected governor.

Onley died Saturday, according to family members. Photo: Carol Vaughn Onley and her son, David Rogers, in 2016 participated in an apprenticeship program of Virginia Humanities' Virginia Folklife Program, in which Rogers was apprenticed to his mother to study her art form. The folklife program is dedicated to the documentation, presentation and support of Virginia’s cultural heritage. Onley in recent years was a familiar sight at the annual Eastern Shore Heritage Festival at Eastern Shore Community College and at the Onancock Market on summer Saturday mornings, where she greeted passers-by. She would be surrounded by her colorful artworks ranging from paintings of Biblical themes — including Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden, Jonah and the Whale and the Last Supper — to papier-mache ""watermelon angels"" and sculptures of cats and crabs and cardinals, among the many subjects she captured in her art.","['painter', 'va', '(delmarva', 'now)', '—', 'mary', '""mama', 'girl""',

50,Give Local 757: The Hurrah Players performing arts group,13NewsNow,https://www.13newsnow.com/article/entertainment/arts/the-hurrah-players-theatre-give-local-757/291-998ee410-3b8a-4175-b8b8-adddc5d77ee6,Norfolk,04/2022,"NORFOLK, Va. — All month long, 13News Now is highlighting important non-profits in Hampton Roads ahead of the area’s annual day of giving: Give Local 757. When you think about performing arts in Hampton Roads, The Hurrah Players is likely the first organization that comes to mind. For 37 years, The Hurrah Players has served our community with more than just award-winning theatre productions. “It’s the working together for the betterment of everybody,” said Hugh Copeland. Copeland is the man behind it all: the founder, the inspirer, and the grateful instructor. “Think about it, I have students who want to learn,” said Copeland. “They are hungry for it. They want it.” Right now, the players are prepping for a Mother’s Day weekend performance of ""How I Became a Pirate."" It’s just one of the more than 200 shows produced by the organization in its four decades in Hampton Roads, and the organization has never turned down a student because of cost. In fact, almost 50% of students receive help with tuition. Copeland said investment in these students is an investment in the entire region. “The arts are crucial for the community. Everybody needs it, not just a select few,” said Copeland. “And by enjoying the arts we are a closer community and we will work and play together more easily.” After a tough couple of years during the pandemic, it’s up to us to keep the dream and imagination alive. Your donation to The Hurrah Players helps the organization continue its acting classes, theatre camps, workshops, and main-stage productions. “We could not exist without the continued support of the community,” said Copeland.","['norfolk', 'va', '—', 'all', 'month', 'long', '13news', 'now', 'is', 'highlighting', 'important', 'non-profits', 'in', 'hampton', 'roads', 'ahead', 'of', 'the', 'area’s', 'annual', 'day', 'of', 'giving', 'give', 'local', '757', 'when', 'you', 'think', 'about', 'performing', 'arts', 'in', 'hampton', 'roads', 'the', 'hurrah', 'players', 'is', 'likely', 'the', 'first', 'organization', 'that', 'comes', 'to', 'mind', 'for', '37', 'years', 'the', 'hurrah', 'players', 'has', 'served', 'our', 'community', 'with', 'more', 'than', 'just', 'award-winning', 'theatre', 'productions', '“it’s', 'the', 'working', 'together', 'for', 'the', 'betterment', 'of', 'everybody', '”', 'said', 'hugh', 'copeland', 'copeland', 'is', 'the', 'man', 'behind', 'it', 'all', 'the', 'founder', 'the', 'inspirer', 'and', 'the', 'grateful', 'instructor', '“think', 'about', 'it', 'i', 'have', 'students', 'who', 'want', 'to', 'learn', '”', 'said', 'copeland', '“they', 'are', 'hungry', 'for', 'it', 'they', 'want', 'it', '”', 'right', 'now', 'the', 'players', 'are', 'prepping', 'for', 'a', 'mother’s', 'day', 'weekend', 'performance', 'of', '""how', 'i', 'became', 'a', 'pirate', '""', 'it’s', 'just', 'one', 'of', 'the', 'more', 'than', '200', 'shows', 'produced', 'by', 'the', 'organization', 'in', 'its', 'four', 'decades', 'in', 'hampton', 'roads', 'and', 'the', 'organization', 'has', 'never', 'turned', 'down', 'a', 'student', 'because', 'of', 'cost', 'in', 'fact', 'almost', '50%', 'of', 'students', 'receive', 'help', 'with', 'tuition', 'copeland', 'said', 'investment', 'in', 'these', 'students', 'is', 'an', 'investment', 'in', 'the', 'entire', 'region', '“the', 'arts', 'are', 'crucial', 'for', 'the', 'community', 'everybody', 'needs', 'it', 'not', 'just', 'a', 'select', 'few', '”', 'said', 'copeland', '“and', 'by', 'enjoying', 'the', 'arts', 'we', 'are', 'a', 'closer', 'community', 'and', 'we', 'will', 'work', 'and', 'play', 'together', 'more', 'easily', '”', 'after', 'a', 'tough', 'couple', 'of', 'years', 'during', 'the', 'pandemic', 'it’s', 'up', 'to', 'us', 'to', 'keep', 'the', 'dream', 'and', 'imagination', 'alive', 'your', 'donation', 'to', 'the', 'hurrah', 'players', 'helps', 'the', 'organization', 'continue', 'its', 'acting', 'classes', 'theatre', 'camps', 'workshops', 'and', 'main-stage', 'productions', '“we', 'could', 'not', 'exist', 'without', 'the', 'continued', 'support', 'of', 'the', 'community', '”', 'said', 'copeland']","['important', 'just', 'grateful', 'right', 'just', 'help', 'just', 'will', 'dream', 'support']","['hungry', 'down']",4.0,2022.0,"norfolk  va  — all month long  13news now is highlighting important non-profits in hampton roads ahead of the area’s annual day of giving give local 757  when you think about performing arts in hampton roads  the hurrah players is likely the first organization that comes to mind  for 37 years  the hurrah players has served our community with more than just award-winning theatre productions  “it’s the working together for the betterment of everybody ” said hugh copeland  copeland is the man behind it all the founder  the inspirer  and the grateful instructor  “think about it  i have students who want to learn ” said copeland  “they are hungry for it  they want it ” right now  the players are prepping for a mother’s day weekend performance of ""how i became a pirate "" it’s just one of the more than 200 shows produced by the organization in its four decades in hampton roads  and the organization has never turned down a student because of cost  in fact  almost 50% of students receive help with tuition  copeland said investment in these students is an investment in the entire region  “the arts are crucial for the community  everybody needs it  not just a select few ” said copeland  “and by enjoying the arts we are a closer community and we will work and play together more easily ” after a tough couple of years during the pandemic  it’s up to us to keep the dream and imagination alive  your donation to the hurrah players helps the organization continue its acting classes  theatre camps  workshops  and main-stage productions  “we could not exist without the continued support of the community ” said copeland ","['ate', 'class', 'ion', 'n', 'nd', 'tho', 'unity ', 'yo', '', '', '', '', '', '']",10,2,14,279

Curator John Rudel says the exhibit, called “Healing and Hope,” was originally inspired by the mass shooting last May in Virginia Beach. “We decided to open up the theme to much broader notions of healing and hope,"" Rudel said. “We had students dealing with personal issues, students dealing with the environment, students dealing with gun violence.” More than 80 students from about a dozen local high schools submitted different forms of art, interpreting the assignment in a number of different ways to create an outlook of hopefulness. RELATED: IN SESSION: Local teen helps protect schools from active shooter threats ""Clearly there’s a lot of young voices out there that want to be heard,"" said Rudel. “And this venue kind of confirms for them that they have a voice and that their voice should be heard.” Rudel hopes the exhibit will prove to these young artists they can communicate and even affect change through art. The exhibit is open through December 13 at the Neil Britton Art Gallery on the campus of Virginia Wesleyan University. It’s free and open to the public. The featured high schools and organizations include Bayside High School, First Colonial High School, Granby High School, Great Bridge High School, Kellam High School, Indian River High School, Maury High School, Ocean Lakes High School, Princess Anne High School, Southampton High School, Teens with a Purpose, The Governor’s School, and Tidewater Collegiate Academy.","['virginia', 'beach', 'va', '—', 'students', 'in', 'hampton', 'roads', 'are', 'expressing', 'themselves', 'through', 'original', 'artwork', 'on', 'display', 'now', 'at', 'virginia', 'wesleyan', 'university', 'curator', 'john', 'rudel', 'says', 'the', 'exhibit', 'called', '“healing', 'and', 'hope', '”', 'was', 'originally', 'inspired', 'by', 'the', 'mass', 'shooting', 'last', 'may', 'in', 'virginia', 'beach', '“we', 'decided', 'to', 'open', 'up', 'the', 'theme', 'to', 'much', 'broader', 'notions', 'of', 'healing', 'and', 'hope', '""', 'rudel', 'said', '“we', 'had', 'students', 'dealing', 'with', 'personal', 'issues', 'students', 'dealing', 'with', 'the', 'environment', 'students', 'dealing', 'with', 'gun', 'violence', '”', 'more', 'than', '80', 'students', 'from', 'about', 'a', 'dozen', 'local', 'high', 'schools', 'submitted', 'different', 'forms', 'of', 'art', 'interpreting', 'the', 'assignment', 'in', 'a', 'number', 'of', 'different', 'ways', 'to', 'create', 'an', 'outlook', 'of', 'hopefulness', 'related', 'in', 'session', 'local', 'teen', 'helps', 'protect', 'schools', 'from', 'active', 'shooter', 'threats', '""clearly', 'there’s', 'a', 'lot', 'of', 'young', 'voices', 'out', 'there', 'that', 'want', 'to', 'be', 'heard', '""', 'said', 'rudel', '“and', 'this', 'venue', 'kind', 'of', 'confirms', 'for', 'them', 'that', 'they', 'have', 'a', 'voice', 'and', 'that', 'their', 'voice', 'should', 'be', 'heard', '”', 'rudel', 'hopes', 'the', 'exhibit', 'will', 'prove', 'to', 'these', 'young', 'artists', 'they', 'can', 'communicate', 'and', 'even', 'affect', 'change', 'through', 'art', 'the', 'exhibit', 'is', 'open', 'through', 'december', '13', 'at', 'the', 'neil', 'britton', 'art', 'gallery', 'on', 'the', 'campus', 'of', 'virginia', 'wesleyan', 'university', 'it’s', 'free', 'and', 'open', 'to', 'the', 'public', 'the', 'featured', 'high', 'schools', 'and', 'organizations', 'include', 'bayside', 'high', 'school', 'first', 'colonial', 'high', 'school', 'granby', 'high', 'school', 'great', 'bridge', 'high', 'school', 'kellam', 'high', 'school', 'indian', 'river', 'high', 'school', 'maury', 'high', 'school', 'ocean', 'lakes', 'high', 'school', 'princess', 'anne', 'high', 'school', 'southampton', 'high', 'school', 'teens', 'with', 'a', 'purpose', 'the', 'governor’s', 'school', 'and', 'tidewater', 'collegiate', 'academy']","['original', 'hope', 'open', 'hope', 'hopefulness', 'active', 'kind', 'hopes', 'will', 'even', 'open', 'free', 'open', 'great']",['threats'],12.0,2019.0,"virginia beach  va  — students in hampton roads are expressing themselves through original artwork on display now at virginia wesleyan university  curator john rudel says the exhibit  called “healing and hope ” was originally inspired by the mass shooting last may in virginia beach  “we decided to open up the theme to much broader notions of healing and hope "" rudel said  “we had students dealing with personal issues  students dealing with the environment  students dealing with gun violence ” more than 80 students from about a dozen local high schools submitted different forms of art  interpreting the assignment in a number of different ways to create an outlook of hopefulness  related in session local teen helps protect schools from active shooter threats ""clearly there’s a lot of young voices out there that want to be heard "" said rudel  “and this venue kind of confirms for them that they have a voice and that their voice should be heard ” rudel hopes the exhibit will prove to these young artists they can communicate and even affect change through art  the exhibit is open through december 13 at the neil britton art gallery on the campus of virginia wesleyan university  it’s free and open to the public  the featured high schools and organizations include bayside high school  first colonial high school  granby high school  great bridge high school  kellam high school  indian river high school  maury high school  ocean lakes high school  princess anne high school  southampton high school  teens with a purpose  the governor’s school  and tidewater collegiate academy ","['ate', 'be ', 'cat', 'dis', 'hang', 'ice ', 'ion', 'n', 'nd', 'school', 'voice', 'yo', '', '', '', '', '', '']",14,1,18,260

The program allocated almost $1 million to 19 organizations who had to cut back on business to follow COVID-19 capacity limits.


Emily Labows, the director of the Virginia Beach Cultural Affairs Department, said these nonprofits and cultural organizations faced ""unprecedented hardships"" during the pandemic.

“The arts are a source of inspiration, a bridge between communities and an economic engine for the City,"" she said. ""This grant program reflects the City Council’s commitment to ensuring our local arts and cultural organizations survive through this period of adversity and remain strong well into the future.” 

The city's release cited an Americans for the Arts study said Virginia Beach arts nonprofits and cultural centers bring in about $87.7 million in economic activity and 2,875 jobs every year. 

That's not counting the hotel, restaurant or shopping revenue that comes from people visiting the area for those attractions.

These are the organizations who benefitted from the grant money:

55,Making Your Mark: Art for mom,13NewsNow,https://www.13newsnow.com/article/news/local/making-your-mark/making-your-mark-art-for-mom/291-222014220,Norfolk,04/2015,"NORFOLK -- Larry Johnson is experiencing an amazing mid-life renaissance. His artwork was just on display in a gallery inside the Hamm Fine Arts Building at Norfolk State University. It was a big hit. ""I've worked hard and my work has kind of paid off for me,"" said Larry, who's now pursuing his love making sculptures and creating items out of paper, clay, whatever he can get his hands on. His work at NSU featured historical figures like Harriett Tubman and Crispus Attucks. It also featured sculptures of people he's met throughout life. But no sculpture has generated more buzz than one he made of his mother. It's so lifelike, some gallery goers have mistook it for a real person. Larry says the sculpture is a tribute to his aging mom and creating it actually helped him cope with what many others have to come to grips with -- transforming your life to take care of an aging parent. ""Art fulfills me in many ways,"" Larry said. ""It is very therapeutic and art has helped to take me through this process of caring for my mom and taking me through stressful situations."" One stressful situation for his mom is osteoarthritis and Larry is using his artwork to draw attention to that and the need for a cure. ""It's effected her in a way that often times she was very outgoing and mobile now it's kind of restricted her in terms of her mobility and her desire to be creative as she used to be is no longer there."" He highlights that pain by showing a bone exposed on his mother's knee. ""My mother often times describes the pain and or the feeling as a bone on bone type of experience and so I felt it was very important that I show the bone being exposed,"" he said. He says that part of the sculpture has generated a lot of reaction. That's exactly what he wanted. ""The piece speaks for itself so they know that it's someone who's suffering,"" Larry said. He's also happy that it generated a positive reaction from his mom. She told Larry she's proud of him. ""It was a great feeling. My mom is a woman of very few words and to hear her say she was very proud of me is a major thing for me,"" Larry said. Osteoarthritis is the most common form of arthritis. It's estimated that it effects 27 million Americans.","['norfolk', '--', 'larry', 'johnson', 'is', 'experiencing', 'an', 'amazing', 'mid-life', 'renaissance', 'his', 'artwork', 'was', 'just', 'on',

56,Teen artists takeover a street in Virginia Beach,13NewsNow,https://www.13newsnow.com/article/news/community/teen-artists-takeover-a-street-in-virginia-beach/291-444bcf1f-e908-46fb-9d30-65c10ebd5e41,Norfolk,10/2020,"VIRGINIA BEACH, Va. — You can now drive down the Virginia Beach ViBE District and be greeted by something new on every corner. Local teen artists took all those plain gray columns and turned them into something new. The artists who participated were: •      Hanna Chou - Kellam High School – Age 18 •      Grace Duford - Kellam High School – Age 15 •      Carolina Foresta - Governor's School for the Arts – Age 17 •      Gabby Garza - Kellam High School – Age 16 •      Hailey George - Kellam High School – Age 17 •      Emily Griffin - Henrico High School – Age 17 •      Ruby Milliken - Kellam High School – Age 16 •      Ruby Starcher - Grassfield High School – Age 17 The ""V"" shaped pillars mark the corners of the intersections leading from 19th Street at Parks Avenue near the Virginia Beach Convention Center east to Baltic Avenue at the resort. According to organizers, ""The teen artists were chosen from an open call for teen murals from July 2020, which garnered significant response, inspiring the ViBe nonprofit to allow teens first dibs at painting these new landmarks. Artworks are planned to rotate twice a year, allowing for each mural and artist to gain 6 months of exposure."" ""This type of street art design element is the first of its kind in Hampton Roads and possibly the entire Commonwealth of Virginia,"" said Kate Pittman, executive director of the ViBe Creative District. ""Our nonprofit worked closely with the Virginia Beach Strategic Growth Office and City staff who were thoughtful to include public art opportunities in this City of Virginia Beach CIP streetscape project in new and innovative ways, which is critical to defining the arts district.""

57,The MUSE Project: Inspire Arts Collective,13NewsNow,https://www.13newsnow.com/article/news/the-muse-project-inspire-arts-collective/291-161da43c-5c42-479f-853c-73cec2b38ce7,Norfolk,03/2019,"HAMPTON, Va. — Every weekend inside of the Performing Arts Connection dance studio in Hampton, Inspire Arts Collective LLC holds dance classes for people of all experience levels. The company was founded by Shawn Labadie who makes it her mission to ignite hope, equip artists, and challenge the status quo through dance. Labadie began practicing the art of dance from a very young age. She started dancing in her church at the age of nine where her instructor was an Alvin Ailey trained dancer. By 19, she started practicing ballet and began traveling to take dance workshops from industry professionals. Credit: Ryan Bengford Shawn teaching her adult advanced class, Urban and Stylez “I’ve pretty much experienced every technique of dance and have taken all sorts of dance classes, but hip-hop just really resonates with me,” she said. Shawn decided that she wanted to pursue dance professionally. Eventually, she came to the conclusion that she wanted to open a dance company and teach the art of dance to others. Credit: Inspire Arts Collective Inspire Arts Collective “Me creating a dance company in some way it was apart of me answering a need I feel as a dancer,"" Labadie said. Inspire Arts Collective has Beginner Hip-Hop on Saturday mornings for ages seven and up, an advanced class for adults called ""Urban and Stylez"" on Sundays at 5:30 p.m., and then right after, at 6:30 p.m., they have an all-adult female class called “WOMAN”. Ashlei Warren, an assistant instructor and student, has been attending classes at Inspire for more than a year now and admits that she was nervous in the beginning. However, her anxiety quickly subsided as soon as she stepped foot into the WOMAN class. “Different dance classes may not be as welcoming as you want them to be. Especially if you haven’t danced in a while or you really don't feel like you know what you are doing,” Warren explained. “When I came in, it was the complete opposite. Everyone was so warm and welcoming. It was like a big family. I was blown away!” Credit: Stephen Wozny Ashlei Warren has been attending classes at Inspire Arts Collective for the past year Mary Hall is a student who has been attending classes at Inspire for the past three years, shortly after Shawn opened the company. Hall mainly attends the WOMAN class and heard about it initially through a friend. She has taken her fair share of dance classes from aerobics to Zumba in many different gyms but says that she has never experienced anything like Inspire Arts Collective before. RELATED: The MUSE Project: OnieTonie “Sometimes when you go to classes in gyms, there can be a very competitive atmosphere. There can be intimidation, fear, or even some prejudice but this place is nothing like that at all,” Hall stated. Both Mary and Ashlei proclaim Inspire Arts Collective’s WOMAN class to be both a challenging and empowering experience. Labadie said that her reason for creating the class derived from her own growing pains. Credit: Ryan Bengford Mary Hall says she has never experienced anything like WOMAN before “Growing up I was not the most secure woman. I had a lot of insecurities and I found it hard to know my own worth as a woman. So I wanted to create a class where women could come and feel accepted and also see that you can have sisters, you can have real girlfriends, and you can have people rooting for you and we can support you on this journey called womanhood.” Warren also stated that what makes the WOMAN class so special are the personal connections that you make with others. She receives a level of support from the other women that help keep her motivated and encouraged. Mary admits that she doesn’t possess a background in hip-hop dance and sometimes struggles to keep up, but this class has taught her to persevere through the tough moments even when she feels like giving up. RELATED: The MUSE Project: The Orange Avenue Project “In this class, there are plenty of moves that I see Shawn doing and I’m just like, ‘there is no way I can do that!’ and then I keep trying, and trying, and trying and even if I don’t get it perfect, it’s okay,” Hall claimed. “So I’ve learned to keep trying even when things seem a little bit rough.” According to Labadie, Inspire Arts Collective is the only dance company in Hampton that offers hip hop classes and dance classes that empower women for all levels on the peninsula. She hopes that women that come to take this class not only leave with some new dance moves to add to their repertoire (if they have one) but to also walk away with a deeper lesson. Credit: Stephen Wozny Shawn says that no experience is needed to dance at Inspire “I hope that women who come to our class realize that they are enough. That no matter what anyone says, you as a person are enough. I not only want them to dance and to have a good time but I want them to feel empowered in dance. I want them to take the lessons that they have learned in dance and take them out into the world,” Labadie stated. RELATED: The MUSE Project: The Quality Comedy King Since we wrapped filming of Inspire Arts Collective’s documentary, Shawn and her family have relocated to Chicago. Labadie has taken it upon herself to start a new WOMAN class based in the Windy City and plans to continue the Inspire Arts Collective legacy in the Midwest.

instructor was an alvin ailey trained dancer  by 19  she started practicing ballet and began traveling to take dance workshops from industry professionals  credit ryan bengford shawn teaching her adult advanced class  urban and stylez “i’ve pretty much experienced every technique of dance and have taken all sorts of dance classes  but hip-hop just really resonates with me ” she said  shawn decided that she wanted to pursue dance professionally  eventually  she came to the conclusion that she wanted to open a dance company and teach the art of dance to others  credit inspire arts collective inspire arts collective “me creating a dance company in some way it was apart of me answering a need i feel as a dancer "" labadie said  inspire arts collective has beginner hip-hop on saturday mornings for ages seven and up  an advanced class for adults called ""urban and stylez"" on sundays at 530 p m   and then right after  at 630 p m   they have an all-adult female class called “woman”  ashlei warren  an assistant instructor and student  has been attending classes at inspire for more than a year now and admits that she was nervous in the beginning  however  her anxiety quickly subsided as soon as she stepped foot into the woman class  “different dance classes may not be as welcoming as you want them to be  especially if you haven’t danced in a while or you really don't feel like you know what you are doing ” warren explained  “when i came in  it was the complete opposite  everyone was so warm and welcoming  it was like a big family  i was blown away!” credit stephen wozny ashlei warren has been attending classes at inspire arts collective for the past year mary hall is a student who has been attending classes at inspire for the past three years  shortly after shawn opened the company  hall mainly attends the woman class and heard about it initially through a friend  she has taken her fair share of dance classes from aerobics to zumba in many different gyms but says that she has never experienced anything like inspire arts collective before  related the muse project onietonie “sometimes when you go to classes in gyms  there can be a very competitive atmosphere  there can be intimidation  fear  or even some prejudice but this place is nothing like that at all ” hall stated  both mary and ashlei proclaim inspire arts collective’s woman class to be both a challenging and empowering experience  labadie said that her reason for creating the class derived from her own growing pains  credit ryan bengford mary hall says she has never experienced anything like woman before “growing up i was not the most secure woman  i had a lot of insecurities and i found it hard to know my own worth as a woman  so i wanted to create a class where women could come and feel accepted and also see that you can have sisters  you can have real girlfriends  and you can have people rooting for you and we can support you on this journey called womanhood ” warren also stated that what makes the woman class so special are the personal connections that you make with others  she receives a level of support from the other women that help keep her motivated and encouraged  mary admits that she doesn’t possess a background in hip-hop dance and sometimes struggles to keep up  but this class has taught her to persevere through the tough moments even when she feels like giving up  related the muse project the orange avenue project “in this class  there are plenty of moves that i see shawn doing and i’m just like  ‘there is no way i can do that!’ and then i keep trying  and trying  and trying and even if i don’t get it perfect  it’s okay ” hall claimed  “so i’ve learned to keep trying even when things seem a little bit rough ” according to labadie  inspire arts collective is the only dance company in hampton that offers hip hop classes and dance classes that empower women for all levels on the peninsula  she hopes that women that come to take this class not only leave with some new dance moves to add to their repertoire (if they have one) but to also walk away with a deeper lesson  credit stephen wozny shawn says that no experience is needed to dance at inspire “i hope that women who come to our class realize that they are enough  that no matter what anyone says  you as a person are enough  i not only want them to dance and to have a good time but i want them to feel empowered in dance  i want them to take the lessons that they have learned in dance and take them out into the world ” labadie stated

60,"13News Now Investigates: Hampton Roads police departments turn to gunshot detection technology, but is it effective?",13NewsNow,https://www.13newsnow.com/article/news/local/13news-now-investigates/hampton-roads-police-department-gunshot-detection-technology-effective/291-3a7f6285-9186-4a9d-88c2-507468ba07bd,Norfolk,02/2022,"NEWPORT NEWS, Va. — To fight gun violence, Hampton Roads police departments are turning to gunshot detection companies, such as ShotSpotter. 

The technology is designed to identify the sound and location of gunshots and send alerts to officers.

Police department leaders praise the sensors for triggering quicker response times and helping with investigations.


13News Now Investigates set out to answer: How effective are these surveillance systems, what does data show, and what does it mean for the communities where these sensors are in place?

Police Advocacy of Gunshot Detection Technology
Newport News Police Chief Steve Drew is an advocate for technology-aided policing, quick to point out the advantages of innovation.

""[ShotSpotter has] sped things up for us, been very valuable on some of the investigations we've dealt with in finding evidence and finding shooting victims,"" Drew said.

The Newport News Police Department was the first police department in Hampton Roads to use an acoustic gunshot detection system, adding ShotSpotter in 2019.

""Now, even if no one calls [to report gunshots], we are coming even before we get a call from our dispatch center, so that’s why I believe it sends a strong message to our community, it’s a great response tool and investigative tool that we have.""

NNPD uses ShotSpotter to cover a 3-square mile area in South Newport News, which Drew said was picked due to crime statistics.

""It was strictly because of firearms, shootings and homicides that we had in that particular area, that’s why that area was selected,"" he said.

Drew said ShotSpotter even helps his investigators refute claims from citizens, who may report that they were shot at one location, but the acoustic technology shows a different location.

In 2021, the Virginia Beach Police Department added ShotSpotter sensors to its investigative arsenal, covering both the Virginia Beach Oceanfront and Western Bayside areas, 4 square miles in total.

A public records request of VBPD emails related to the purchase and subscription of ShotSpotter technology showed the sides agreed to a 6-month pilot program, allowing the City of Virginia Beach to test out the system before agreeing to a multi-year contract. In July, a ShotSpotter representative presented the technology to VBPD team members. 

Chief Paul Neudigate responded to a follow-up email from the ShotSpotter representative by saying, in part: ""A lot of moving parts but I did want my team to get an understanding on what is being offered and see if there is a way for us to incorporate it as a win for both of us. Captain Zelms has been instructed to get the ball rolling on the agreement.""

Throughout the pilot program, Neudigate, Zelms and other VBPD leaders emailed multiple times to check on the contract status and support the procurement of a ShotSpotter agreement.

Virginia Beach police have since been quick to promote ShotSpotter -- first when the technology went live, after the first ShotSpotter-related arrest, when shell casings are found, and consistently in multiple, recent press releases.

Chief Neudigate canceled a scheduled interview with 13News Now to discuss ShotSpotter in January due to inclement weather, and VBPD Public Affairs said he was unable to reschedule in the weeks to follow. 

He previously said ShotSpotter could be a ""game-changer for the department"" and has openly praised the technology.

Portsmouth police and city leaders said in January they're considering adding ShotSpotter to help address the city's rise in gun violence.

Chesapeake Police Chief Kelvin Wright told 13News Now in January that he's considering adding a similar acoustic gunshot detection system as well, one that would cover a wider area of the city.

Questions and Early Hampton Roads Data
Despite the advocacy from police department leaders, many details about ShotSpotter and the usage of gunshot detection systems are a mystery to the public.

The specific locations of sensors -- whether on buildings or street posts or elsewhere -- are exempt from public records requests under Virginia law as tactical information, according to NNPD and VBPD. Additionally, in Newport News, citizens don't know how many ShotSpotter activations have led to evidence or arrests. 

In response to a FOIA request, a Newport News Police Department spokesperson said: ""All ShotSpotter Data and records are the sole and exclusive property of ShotSpotter, and the Newport News Police Department is expressly prohibited from distributing or making the data or records available to anyone outside.""

NNPD denied a request to retrieve and share this information from ShotSpotter and said no formal record exists in reference to how many arrests have been made as a result of ShotSpotter activations since its implementation. 

When asked why the department would not release this information, Chief Drew pointed to active investigations. 

""With all due respect, there are certain things I'm not going jeopardize,"" Drew said. ""I don't want to hurt or damage or cause any problems to active or ongoing cases.""

JaQuana Phillips, a community member who grew up in a Newport News neighborhood that's now covered by the ShotSpotter surveillance system, said that's discouraging.

She believes the technology has been helpful, but she wants proof.

""I don’t think that information should be concealed,"" Phillips said. ""I think people should start comparing the numbers to see how crime has shaped and shifted since they started implementing those things.""

Virginia Beach police, however, did respond to a records request from 13News Now requesting the results of ShotSpotter activations.

In the first four months of using ShotSpotter in two parts of the city, Virginia Beach police received 101 alerts. 

Those notifications led to five arrests, four of which were for reckless handling of a gun.

ShotSpotter alerts helped police find three shooting victims, but no arrests were made in these reported shootings following a ShotSpotter activation. The Effectiveness and Cost of Gunshot Detection Systems
Research and studies in other parts of the country raise some questions about how effective and cost-efficient gunshot detection systems are at curbing gun violence.

""What we found in Chicago is more than 9 times out of 10, when police go out in response to a ShotSpotter alert, they don’t find any kind of gun-related incident,"" said Jonathan Manes, an attorney for the MacArthur Justice Center.

Manes was part of a team that analyzed more than 46,000 ShotSpotter Alerts in Chicago over the past three years.

He said there’s ""very little evidence"" that gunshot detection systems reduce gun violence and questions about how well this technology identifies gunshots.

""Police are going out in response to alerts about supposed shots fired much more frequently, which is a burden on police resources in addition to the cost of the contract for the system itself,"" he said. ""Almost every city that I’m aware doesn’t do validation testing once the system is put in place, so there’s a real question about its fundamental efficacy.""

Newport News taxpayers are paying $195,000 each year for ShotSpotter, and Virginia Beach taxpayers are set to pay $280,000 each year to cover a larger area.

""I think one important question is, 'Can we be spending money in ways that will prevent and reduce violence in the first place?'"" Manes said, referring to preventative outreach and violence interruption programs.

Some community members have also questioned where this technology is used.

In Newport News, Phillips said she is grateful for quicker response times to shootings, but she also knows who lives in the areas that the sensors cover.

""I think these technologies have only been implemented in communities of black and brown and communities of minority, it all goes back to systematic things.""

Manes said if police officers are responding to many more ""shots fired"" alerts, it could lead to more unnecessary and potentially hostile stops that everyone wants to avoid.

ShotSpotter Response
ShotSpotter, which has contracts with more than 120 cities across the country, objects to any concerns about the efficacy and accuracy of its products, citing varied statistics in crime trends on its website.

It also rejects the assertion that ShotSpotter coverage areas could lead to over-policing or potentially dangerous police deployments, saying that all residents deserve ""rapid police response"" and that police officers arrive with ""enhanced situational awareness"" - not ""'hyped up' potentially creating dangerous situations.""

The company's public relations team is quick to push back against criticism, a strategy that has been outlined by various news organizations.

Featured at the top of the ShotSpotter website, the company has a published list of ""false claims"" and ""myths"" that it addresses on its own.

Among the web page is a link to ""success stories"" from police departments around the United States, including one connected to NNPD in which Assistant Police Chief Eric Randall calls the technology an ""investigative game-changer.""

A filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission detailed these success stories as a marketing strategy to show ""proof of value to prospects.""

ShotSpotter sent multiple statements to 13News Now. Among them, the company said police departments know the effectiveness of its gunshot detection sensors, ""which is why ShotSpotter has earned trust and high renewal rates from our customers.""

In response to the MacArthur Justice Center study cited by Manes in Chicago, ShotSpotter said the report ""draws erroneous conclusions based on the interpretation of police report categorizations, falsely equating them with no shots fired,"" and said city leaders support the use of the technology.

In response to the VBPD pilot program's early data, ShotSpotter said ""not every alert leads to an immediate arrest"" so arrest data is ""not an accurate way to measure ShotSpotter's effectiveness.""

For each study or analysis that raises questions about the technology, ShotSpotter seems to have a response.

In St. Louis, a Metropolitan Police Department Crime Analysis Unit study found ""no crime trend differences"" in neighborhoods with ShotSpotter sensors compared to those without, and said ShotSpotter alerts “seem to replace traditional calls for service and do so less efficiently and at a greater” cost to police departments.

ShotSpotter responded to this study with a link to a NYU Policing Project study which found a decrease in reported assaults across SS coverage areas. It also shared a link to a later opinion-editorial from one of the listed authors from the St. Louis study counters ShotSpotter criticism. 

Another example: a Johns Hopkins and University of Connecticut study found ShotSpotter has ""no significant impact on firearm-related homicides or arrest outcomes,"" saying ""policy solutions may represent a more cost-effective measure to reduce"" gun violence.

ShotSpotter responded and said that by evaluating homicide data from the entire county over multiple years, as opposed to only the portion of the county that is covered by ShotSpotter, the Johns Hopkins study is equating ""apples to oranges"" as ShotSpotter wouldn't have an impact on homicide rates elsewhere in the county.

The company also provided links to other studies, articles and testimonials to advocate for the benefits of ShotSpotter, including links to the aforementioned articles referencing VBPD press releases.

Utilization of Gunshot Detection Technology
Chief Drew said that between a ShotSpotter alert and a 911 call, the only thing that changes for an officer is how quickly they can respond to a scene.

He also said it’s shortsighted to only use data to evaluate how effective the technology is at reducing gun violence.

“How do you measure that, the public feeling safe and perception, it’s a lot more than, well, this activation led to this many arrests and you only uncovered this many crimes, there’s also the human factor that plays a big role,"" he said.

Phillips said she knows people in Newport News who have told her, anecdotally, that it seems like police officers arrive at the scene of a shooting more quickly in recent years. 

Although, she would like to see that proven through independent analysis.

""So we can understand how our taxpayer dollars are being used, what are we paying for?""

Manes said that's a rational concern.

""I think it’s wise to be an informed consumer and a skeptical consumer and to make sure the city is getting value from that,"" he said.

Chief Drew said he understands concerns over the utilization of police resources.

""There is a cost to it. We have to be responsible to taxpayers' dollars, evidence-based, data-driven,"" he said.

Drew ends the interview by describing how frustrated he is when there's a shooting and no one calls 911. In his opinion, having sensors in parts of the city is at least worth it to produce a consistent officer response.

""Maybe [people who don't call 911] think someone else is going to get involved, I’m afraid in my neighborhood, I don’t want somebody knocking on my door or that just happens here, police don’t care, look they don’t even come by,"" Drew said. ""So, sending an officer in that neighborhood, an officer getting out and looking around, that sends a message to that community that they do matter to me.""","['newport', 'news', 'va', '—', 'to',

departments are turning to gunshot detection companies  such as shotspotter  

the technology is designed to identify the sound and location of gunshots and send alerts to officers 

police department leaders praise the sensors for triggering quicker response times and helping with investigations 


13news now investigates set out to answer how effective are these surveillance systems  what does data show  and what does it mean for the communities where these sensors are in place 

police advocacy of gunshot detection technology
newport news police chief steve drew is an advocate for technology-aided policing  quick to point out the advantages of innovation 

""[shotspotter has] sped things up for us  been very valuable on some of the investigations we've dealt with in finding evidence and finding shooting victims "" drew said 

the newport news police department was the first police department in hampton roads to use an acoustic gunshot detection system  adding shotspotter in 2019 

""now  even if no one calls [to report gunshots]  we are coming even before we get a call from our dispatch center  so that’s why i believe it sends a strong message to our community  it’s a great response tool and investigative tool that we have ""

nnpd uses shotspotter to cover a 3-square mile area in south newport news  which drew said was picked due to crime statistics 

""it was strictly because of firearms  shootings and homicides that we had in that particular area  that’s why that area was selected "" he said 

drew said shotspotter even helps his investigators refute claims from citizens  who may report that they were shot at one location  but the acoustic technology shows a different location 

in 2021  the virginia beach police department added shotspotter sensors to its investigative arsenal  covering both the virginia beach oceanfront and western bayside areas  4 square miles in total 

a public records request of vbpd emails related to the purchase and subscription of shotspotter technology showed the sides agreed to a 6-month pilot program  allowing the city of virginia beach to test out the system before agreeing to a multi-year contract  in july  a shotspotter representative presented the technology to vbpd team members  

chief paul neudigate responded to a follow-up email from the shotspotter representative by saying  in part ""a lot of moving parts but i did want my team to get an understanding on what is being offered and see if there is a way for us to incorporate it as a win for both of us  captain zelms has been instructed to get the ball rolling on the agreement ""

throughout the pilot program  neudigate  zelms and other vbpd leaders emailed multiple times to check on the contract status and support the procurement of a shotspotter agreement 

virginia beach police have since been quick to promote shotspotter -- first when the technology went live  after the first shotspotter-related arrest  when shell casings are found  and consistently in multiple  recent press releases 

chief neudigate canceled a scheduled interview with 13news now to discuss shotspotter in january due to inclement weather  and vbpd public affairs said he was unable to reschedule in the weeks to follow  

he previously said shotspotter could be a ""game-changer for the department"" and has openly praised the technology 

portsmouth police and city leaders said in january they're considering adding shotspotter to help address the city's rise in gun violence 

chesapeake police chief kelvin wright told 13news now in january that he's considering adding a similar acoustic gunshot detection system as well  one that would cover a wider area of the city 

questions and early hampton roads data
despite the advocacy from police department leaders  many details about shotspotter and the usage of gunshot detection systems are a mystery to the public 

the specific locations of sensors -- whether on buildings or street posts or elsewhere -- are exempt from public records requests under virginia law as tactical information  according to nnpd and vbpd  additionally  in newport news  citizens don't know how many shotspotter activations have led to evidence or arrests  

in response to a foia request  a newport news police department spokesperson said ""all shotspotter data and records are the sole and exclusive property of shotspotter  and the newport news police department is expressly prohibited from distributing or making the data or records available to anyone outside ""

nnpd denied a request to retrieve and share this information from shotspotter and said no formal record exists in reference to how many arrests have been made as a result of shotspotter activations since its implementation  

when asked why the department would not release this information  chief drew pointed to active investigations  

""with all due respect  there are certain things i'm not going jeopardize "" drew said  ""i don't want to hurt or damage or cause any problems to active or ongoing cases ""

jaquana phillips  a community member who grew up in a newport news neighborhood that's now covered by the shotspotter surveillance system  said that's discouraging 

she believes the technology has been helpful  but she wants proof 

""i don’t think that information should be concealed "" phillips said  ""i think people should start comparing the numbers to see how crime has shaped and shifted since they started implementing those things ""

virginia beach police  however  did respond to a records request from 13news now requesting the results of shotspotter activations 

in the first four months of using shotspotter in two parts of the city  virginia beach police received 101 alerts  

those notifications led to five arrests  four of which were for reckless handling of a gun 

shotspotter alerts helped police find three shooting victims  but no arrests were made in these reported shootings following a shotspotter activation  the effectiveness and cost of gunshot detection systems
research and studies in other parts of the country raise some questions about how effective and cost-efficient gunshot detection systems are at curbing gun violence 

""what we found in chicago is more than 9 times out of 10  when police go out in response to a shotspotter alert  they don’t find any kind of gun-related incident "" said jonathan manes  an attorney for the macarthur justice center 

manes was part of a team that analyzed more than 46 000 shotspotter alerts in chicago over the past three years 

he said there’s ""very little evidence"" that gunshot detection systems reduce gun violence and questions about how well this technology identifies gunshots 

""police are going out in response to alerts about supposed shots fired much more frequently  which is a burden on police resources in addition to the cost of the contract for the system itself "" he said  ""almost every city that i’m aware doesn’t do validation testing once the system is put in place  so there’s a real question about its fundamental efficacy ""

newport news taxpayers are paying $195 000 each year for shotspotter  and virginia beach taxpayers are set to pay $280 000 each year to cover a larger area 

""i think one important question is  'can we be spending money in ways that will prevent and reduce violence in the first place '"" manes said  referring to preventative outreach and violence interruption programs 

some community members have also questioned where this technology is used 

in newport news  phillips said she is grateful for quicker response times to shootings  but she also knows who lives in the areas that the sensors cover 

""i think these technologies have only been implemented in communities of black and brown and communities of minority  it all goes back to systematic things ""

manes said if police officers are responding to many more ""shots fired"" alerts  it could lead to more unnecessary and potentially hostile stops that everyone wants to avoid 

shotspotter response
shotspotter  which has contracts with more than 120 cities across the country  objects to any concerns about the efficacy and accuracy of its products  citing varied statistics in crime trends on its website 

it also rejects the assertion that shotspotter coverage areas could lead to over-policing or potentially dangerous police deployments  saying that all residents deserve ""rapid police response"" and that police officers arrive with ""enhanced situational awareness"" - not ""'hyped up' potentially creating dangerous situations ""

the company's public relations team is quick to push back against criticism  a strategy that has been outlined by various news organizations 

featured at the top of the shotspotter website  the company has a published list of ""false claims"" and ""myths"" that it addresses on its own 

among the web page is a link to ""success stories"" from police departments around the united states  including one connected to nnpd in which assistant police chief eric randall calls the technology an ""investigative game-changer ""

a filing with the u s  securities and exchange commission detailed these success stories as a marketing strategy to show ""proof of value to prospects ""

shotspotter sent multiple statements to 13news now  among them  the company said police departments know the effectiveness of its gunshot detection sensors  ""which is why shotspotter has earned trust and high renewal rates from our customers ""

in response to the macarthur justice center study cited by manes in chicago  shotspotter said the report ""draws erroneous conclusions based on the interpretation of police report categorizations  falsely equating them with no shots fired "" and said city leaders support the use of the technology 

in response to the vbpd pilot program's early data  shotspotter said ""not every alert leads to an immediate arrest"" so arrest data is ""not an accurate way to measure shotspotter's effectiveness ""

for each study or analysis that raises questions about the technology  shotspotter seems to have a response 

in st  louis  a metropolitan police department crime analysis unit study found ""no crime trend differences"" in neighborhoods with shotspotter sensors compared to those without  and said shotspotter alerts “seem to replace traditional calls for service and do so less efficiently and at a greater” cost to police departments 

shotspotter responded to this study with a link to a nyu policing project study which found a decrease in reported assaults across ss coverage areas  it also shared a link to a later opinion-editorial from one of the listed authors from the st  louis study counters shotspotter criticism  

another example a johns hopkins and university of connecticut study found shotspotter has ""no significant impact on firearm-related homicides or arrest outcomes "" saying ""policy solutions may represent a more cost-effective measure to reduce"" gun violence 

shotspotter responded and said that by evaluating homicide data from the entire county over multiple years  as opposed to only the portion of the county that is covered by shotspotter  the johns hopkins study is equating ""apples to oranges"" as shotspotter wouldn't have an impact on homicide rates elsewhere in the county 

the company also provided links to other studies  articles and testimonials to advocate for the benefits of shotspotter  including links to the aforementioned articles referencing vbpd press releases 

utilization of gunshot detection technology
chief drew said that between a shotspotter alert and a 911 call  the only thing that changes for an officer is how quickly they can respond to a scene 

he also said it’s shortsighted to only use data to evaluate how effective the technology is at reducing gun violence 

“how do you measure that  the public feeling safe and perception  it’s a lot more than  well  this activation led to this many arrests and you only uncovered this many crimes  there’s also the human factor that plays a big role "" he said 

phillips said she knows people in newport news who have told her  anecdotally  that it seems like police officers arrive at the scene of a shooting more quickly in recent years  

although  she would like to see that proven through independent analysis 

""so we can understand how our taxpayer dollars are being used  what are we paying for ""

manes said that's a rational concern 

""i think it’s wise to be an informed consumer and a skeptical consumer and to make sure the city is getting value from that "" he said 

chief drew said he understands concerns over the utilization of police resources 

""there is a cost to it  we have to be responsible to taxpayers' dollars  evidence-based  data-driven "" he said 

drew ends the interview by describing how frustrated he is when there's a shooting and no one calls 911  in his opinion  having sensors in parts of the city is at least worth it to produce a consistent officer response 

""maybe [people who don't call 911] think someone else is going to get involved  i’m afraid in my neighborhood  i don’t want somebody knocking on my door or that just happens here  police don’t care  look they don’t even come by "" drew said  ""so  sending an officer in that neighborhood  an officer getting out and looking around  that sends a message to that community that they do matter to me ""","['advocate', 'ate', 'ax', 'be ', 'been', 'black', 'cap', 'cat', 'che', 'dis', 'doe', 'hang', 'hood', 'ice ', 'ion', 'justice', 'link ', 'lit', 'mean ', 'minority', 'n', 'nd', 'perception ', 'rap', 'real ', 'respect', 'serve ', 'sis', 'status ', 'tea', 'tho', 'unity ', 'yo', '', '', '', '', '', '']",62,40,39,2159
61,Hampton Roads is testing ground for new flood navigation technology,13NewsNow,https://www.13newsnow.com/article/news/local/flood-navigation-norfolk-virginia-beach/291-03945714-2d5e-41bb-8bc4-af28147405c6,Norfolk,08/2021,"NORFOLK, Va. — Even a small amount of rain in Hampton Roads can cause roadways to flood, creating a maze of detours and added frustration for drivers.

But for more than a year now, a team has been working to make the situation a little less stressful.

“For a coastal community like ours, we’ll never be able to raise all the roads and build walls around cities to protect,” said Paul Robinson, Executive Director of RISE in Norfolk. “This is a way of adapting.”


RISE is a non-profit that looks for, and helps, start-ups developing innovations in coastal resilience.

They recently connected with Australian company FloodMapp to create a real-time, street-to-street flood navigation tool.

“This is not done anywhere,” said Robinson. “It’s one of a kind.”

Current flood data and warnings are relatively broad, but Floodmapp’s model will integrate with navigation app WAZE to give drivers live traffic routing updates and notifications.

Norfolk and Virginia Beach are the testing grounds for the new technology - that means the work happening right now locally could eventually be used in cities all across the country.

FloodMapp hopes to launch the technology to the public by the end of the year.","['norfolk', 'va', '—', 'even', 'a', 'small', 'amount', 'of', 'rain', 'in', 'hampton', 'roads', 'can', 'cause', 'roadways', 'to', 'flood', 'creating', 'a', 'maze', 'of', 'detours', 'and', 'added', 'frustration', 'for', 'drivers', 'but', 'for', 'more', 'than', 'a', 'year', 'now', 'a', 'team', 'has', 'been', 'working', 'to', 'make', 'the', 'situation', 'a', 'little', 'less', 'stressful', '“for', 'a', 'coastal', 'community', 'like', 'ours', 'we’ll', 'never', 'be', 'able', 'to', 'raise', 'all', 'the', 'roads', 'and', 'build', 'walls', 'around', 'cities', 'to', 'protect', '”', 'said', 'paul', 'robinson', 'executive', 'director', 'of', 'rise', 'in', 'norfolk', '“this', 'is', 'a', 'way', 'of', 'adapting', '”', 'rise', 'is', 'a', 'non-profit', 'that', 'looks', 'for', 'and', 'helps', 'start-ups', 'developing', 'innovations', 'in', 'coastal', 'resilience', 'they', 'recently', 'connected', 'with', 'australian', 'company', 'floodmapp', 'to', 'create', 'a', 'real-time', 'street-to-street', 'flood', 'navigation', 'tool', '“this', 'is', 'not', 'done', 'anywhere', '”', 'said', 'robinson', '“it’s', 'one', 'of', 'a', 'kind', '”', 'current', 'flood', 'data', 'and', 'warnings', 'are', 'relatively', 'broad', 'but', 'floodmapp’s', 'model', 'will', 'integrate', 'with', 'navigation', 'app', 'waze', 'to', 'give', 'drivers', 'live', 'traffic', 'routing', 'updates', 'and', 'notifications', 'norfolk', 'and', 'virginia', 'beach', 'are', 'the', 'testing', 'grounds', 'for', 'the', 'new', 'technology', '-', 'that', 'means', 'the', 'work', 'happening', 'right', 'now', 'locally', 'could', 'eventually', 'be', 'used', 'in', 'cities', 'all', 'across', 'the', 'country', 'floodmapp', 'hopes', 'to', 'launch', 'the', 'technology', 'to', 'the', 'public', 'by', 'the', 'end', 'of', 'the', 'year']","['even', 'able', 'kind', 'broad', 'will', 'live', 'right', 'hopes']","['frustration', 'little', 'less', 'stressful']",8.0,2021.0,"norfolk  va  — even a small amount of rain in hampton roads can cause roadways to flood  creating a maze of detours and added frustration for drivers

62,"Chesapeake Police Dept. takes operations sky high, expanding drone technology",13NewsNow,https://www.13newsnow.com/article/news/crime/chesapeake-police-department-drone-technology/291-296933f8-11e1-4af5-bb65-85ee02771dd9,Norfolk,09/2022,"CHESAPEAKE, Va. — Police are using eyes in the sky to try to improve public safety across Hampton Roads.

In the last few years, city officials budgeted for drone technology to help police officers fight crime.

Recently, the Chesapeake Police Department added to its fleet.

“Prior to drone technology, unless you had a helicopter, which we don’t, there was really no way to get that aerial view,” said Master Police Officer Leo Kosinski. The department’s Unmanned Aircraft Systems Team is made up of eight drones of various sizes and 15 officers.

“With the different pieces of equipment, they are kind of mission-specific so to speak,” Kosinski said.

Kosinski said they use drones a lot to analyze crash scenes from the sky and during search and rescue operations.

“The drone can go several hundred feet and has a zoom camera so we can really search a large area with kind of minimal effort from the air,” Kosinski said.

The drones are a force multiplier helping crews cover more ground, faster.

“Some of our drones have the thermal FLIR infrared type technology, so in the colder times we can actually use the drones up high and you could see heat signatures to try to dial it in a bit more for missing persons or missing children,” Kosinski said.

The buzzing technology even helps police officers get messages to victims or suspects with a speaker system attached.

Two months ago, Kosinski said the department purchased two smaller drones to give police the upper hand in critical indoor situations.

“It is specifically designed to be used inside of a building, so if there was any type of large scale incident, mass casualty, mass shooting incident, we have the ability to deploy that within a structure to either assist with searching, crime scene investigation,” Kosinski said.

Police drone operators have rules to follow.

“We can’t just arbitrarily fly the drone up to a private residence and start peering in windows,” Kosinski said. “We have to have cause to do that, which would require us to get a search warrant.”

Kosinski said department leaders are eager to add more drones to their crime-fighting toolbelt.

“This is just another tool in the toolbox that can help serve the public at large,” Kosinski said.

Over the last few years, Congress passed legislation specifically banning federal organizations and forces from buying or using drones made in China.

recently  the chesapeake police department added to its fleet 

“prior to drone technology  unless you had a helicopter  which we don’t  there was really no way to get that aerial view ” said master police officer leo kosinski  the department’s unmanned aircraft systems team is made up of eight drones of various sizes and 15 officers 

“with the different pieces of equipment  they are kind of mission-specific so to speak ” kosinski said 

kosinski said they use drones a lot to analyze crash scenes from the sky and during search and rescue operations 

“the drone can go several hundred feet and has a zoom camera so we can really search a large area with kind of minimal effort from the air ” kosinski said 

the drones are a force multiplier helping crews cover more ground  faster 

“some of our drones have the thermal flir infrared type technology  so in the colder times we can actually use the drones up high and you could see heat signatures to try to dial it in a bit more for missing persons or missing children ” kosinski said 

the buzzing technology even helps police officers get messages to victims or suspects with a speaker system attached 

two months ago  kosinski said the department purchased two smaller drones to give police the upper hand in critical indoor situations 

“it is specifically designed to be used inside of a building  so if there was any type of large scale incident  mass casualty  mass shooting incident  we have the ability to deploy that within a structure to either assist with searching  crime scene investigation ” kosinski said 

police drone operators have rules to follow 

“we can’t just arbitrarily fly the drone up to a private residence and start peering in windows ” kosinski said  “we have to have cause to do that  which would require us to get a search warrant ”

kosinski said department leaders are eager to add more drones to their crime-fighting toolbelt 

“this is just another tool in the toolbox that can help serve the public at large ” kosinski said 

over the last few years  congress passed legislation specifically banning federal organizations and forces from buying or using drones made in china

63,"Down more than 100 officers, Virginia Beach Police embrace technology to help fight crime",13NewsNow,https://www.13newsnow.com/article/news/crime/virginia-beach-police-technology-help-fight-crime/291-dc40a57b-4496-45c1-80e0-70ac71d0c418,Norfolk,07/2021,"VIRGINIA BEACH, Va. — As cities across the nation and in Hampton Roads grapple with surging violence this summer, Virginia Beach is bucking the trend.

Violent crime in the city is down this year despite the March shootings at the Oceanfront.

13News Now investigates if technology is possibly making the city safer.

Police patrolling the Virginia Beach Oceanfront now have a bird’s eye view of crime as it happens. Capt. Harry McBrien of the Virginia Beach Police Department's Second Precinct demonstrated how some of their cameras work.

“So right here, a pan-tilt zoom camera that can go 360 and zoom in on areas,” McBrien explained.

These new cameras put more eyes on busy areas like on Atlantic Avenue, where the police department recently invested in a brand new substation.

McBrien said the technology comes at an important time, as the department is understaffed by more than 100 police officers.

“The technology that we use is absolutely a force multiplier for us that can cover some of the gaps for us when we don’t have enough officers, so that helps us out,"" McBrien said.

13News Now wanted to know if a camera could ever replace the physical presence of an officer. McBrien was sure in his answer.

“No absolutely not, and that’s why you have to have a layered approach to it,” he said.

That layered approach has helped officers find and confiscate dozens of illegal weapons so far this summer at the Oceanfront. McBrien estimated they've seized at least 75 guns in the past two months at the Oceanfront. 

Over the Independence Day weekend, officers confiscated a gun with an extended magazine capable of firing off 50 rounds.

“Why would you have a handgun with a 50 round drum magazine attached to it?” McBrien asked. ""Is that for personal protection or is that to create havoc? And that’s what we’re finding.""

They’re also finding that, in many cases, these guns are stolen from vehicles. That happened 247 times last year in Virginia Beach. 

The police department even issued a video PSA this summer reminding all gun owners to ""be gun responsible."" That means securing your firearms against theft, and reporting to police if they go missing. ""When everyone’s sleeping, and we have a group of individuals literally canvassing neighborhoods to see what cars are unlocked, it’s easy access, and they’re finding guns in cars,"" said Deputy Chief Sean Adams. ""And those guns are being used and sold illegally on the street, and they’re being used in a lot of these crimes.""

Violent crime was down 18% in Virginia Beach for the first half of 2021 when compared to the previous three years. 

The Oceanfront is located in the city's 2nd Precinct, where violent crime is down 71% over the last month (when compared to this time last year). 

To help crack down on shootings, in mid-July, the Virginia Beach Police Department launched its new “ShotSpotter” technology at the Oceanfront. It’s designed to dispatch police to the exact location of gunfire the second it happens.

The department recognizes that the new technology has its limits. 

McBrien said the cameras and ShotSpotter can help solve, but not necessarily prevent, violent crime.","['virginia', 'beach', 'va', '—', 'as', 'cities', 'across', 'the', 'nation', 'and', 'in',

64,Bon Secours shows off new brain surgery technology,13NewsNow,https://www.13newsnow.com/article/news/local/mycity/norfolk/bon-secours-shows-off-new-brain-surgery-technology/291-559850596,Norfolk,05/2018,"NORFOLK, Va., (WVEC) -- Neurosurgeons at Bon Secours DePaul Medical Center are using new technology that will change the way doctors practice medicine.

It's called BrightMatter by Canadian company Synaptic Medical.

It gives doctors an improved visualization during surgery. It makes it safer for surgeons to safely operate on patients with tumors or other lesions near the brain.


It's a surgical robotic arm with a high-powered digital microscope.

Until now hospital officials said surgeons would have to rely on a traditional optical microscope to view the brain during surgery, but BrightMatter changed all that.

Neurosurgeon Joseph Koen is putting it to use.

""We've had sort of surgical navigation, we've had 3D MRI for a while, but this ... technology allows me to see the fibers around the tumor and that's something we could never see before,"" he said.

The real time, robotic imaging technology provides twice the resolution of a traditional microscope according to its creator.

The robotic arm follows the instruments the surgeon is using through motion sensors and a foot pedal.

DePaul is the second hospital in Virginia to have BrightMatter and the only hospital in Hampton Roads.

""It allows the surgery to be much more safe, and much more efficient. And we can develop a surgical plan that is really much more detailed than we ever could before,"" Koen said.

66, New Mobile Mammography Unit uses 3D technology,13NewsNow,https://www.13newsnow.com/article/news/health/new-mobile-mammography-unit-uses-3d-technology/291-318821312,Norfolk,09/2016,"CHESAPEAKE, Va. (WVEC) -- Chesapeake Regional Healthcare is unveiling a new Mobile Mammography Unit that is equipped with both 2D and 3D technology. It is the first such unit available in Hampton Roads.

The 40-foot mammography unit will travel to communities and businesses across Hampton Roads and offer quick appointments for patients. Screenings usually last about 20 minutes, and the units are set up with private changing area and mammography unit for privacy.


The Mobile Mammography Unit uses technology designed to increase image quality, while significantly decreasing the amount of radiation a patient is exposed to.

CRH says that according to the journal Radiology, 3D mammography (also known as tomosynthesis) has been proven to detect breast cancer at a 27 percent higher rate than traditional 2D mammography.

Dr. Michael Petruschak, the director of imaging at Chesapeake Regional, says he hears it all the time: many busy or working women who don’t have the time to schedule mammograms during their work day.

""This actually brings the mobile unit to them where they are working ... so that it's convenient for them,"" he explains.

He adds that 3D technology has already decreased false positives by 25 percent at Chesapeake Regional.

“We can actually image the breast in different slices. We can see the tissue, even in dense breasts.”

After the image is performed inside of the RV, it's loaded onto the center’s cloud via wifi. Then, 24 to 48 hours later, a radiologist reads the image at Chesapeake Regional Breast Center and calls the patient with the results.

Dr. Petruschak says it's covered by Medicare.

“That's been a real help, because most women who get cancer are older. Hopefully other insurance companies follow suit,” he says.

If you insurance doesn’t cover it, it will cost you $105 out of pocket.

67,"New ""low dose"" CT Imaging available in Hampton Roads",13NewsNow,https://www.13newsnow.com/article/news/health/healthlink/new-low-dose-ct-imaging-available-in-hampton-roads/291-375324205,Norfolk,07/2010,"NORFOLK -- New technology is bringing low dose CT Imaging to Hampton Roads. The64-slice CT scanner has advanced software in itthat allows technicians tobe able toreduce radiation exposure by up to 40 percent while improving the image clarity.

Bon Secours DePaul in Norfolk is the first hospital in the area to have this new $1.2 millionmachine.

The chair of the Department of Radiology at DePaul, Dr. Harry Allen, says, 'For patients that have repeated CT images because of cancer screening and follow up, they end up getting a fairly substantial amount of radiation over their entire lifetime. So if you can reduce the individual dose of these images when we obtain these studies then the patient is better off for it.'

Crisandra Hope agrees. Eight years ago, she had breast cancer and she was in remission until last April when she found out it was back and had metastasized.

'When you went through whatI went through, having to take a whole lot of things that involve radiation, something like this is good. I think it's fantastic,' she said.

Dr.Allen says the new machine can obtain 64 images in less than a second and the whole body -- from head to toe -- can be imaged in less than ten seconds. He saysthe images are about the thickness of a credit card.

'That obviously is the most detailed kind of image that you could possible obtain,' he noted.

For the technicians who use the machine daily, like Kimberly Christian, it's been great.

'Itdoes a lot of things for you. So we're able to get back to our patients sooner. The images are already getting sent over and it just makes the whole process faster from the time they are on the table to the time they leave the department to the time those images go to the radiologist.. Everything is faster,'she explained.

Faster technology means themachine can do a lot of things that older CT machines couldn't do, like evaluate blood vessels in the abdomen, pelvis, brain and even the heart.

'The old CT just wasn't fast enough to obtain clear images of the heart at all. So we need technology of this magnitude to be able to basically stop the motion of the heart to be able to get a clear image of it,'Dr. Allen stated.

The new CT scannerarrived in May and already almost 2,000patients have used it.

Hope adds,'That makes the biggest difference in the world as far as your comfort and making you feel more relaxed.'","['norfolk', '--', 'new', 'technology', 'is', 'bringing', 'low', 'dose', 'ct', 'imaging', 'to', 'hampton', 'roads', 'the64-slice', 'ct', 'scanner', 'has', 'advanced', 'software', 'in', 'itthat', 'allows', 'technicians', 'tobe', 'able', 'toreduce', 'radiation', 'exposure', 'by', 'up', 'to', '40', 'percent', 'while', 'improving', 'the', 'image', 'clarity', 'bon', 'secours', 'depaul', 'in', 'norfolk', 'is', 'the', 'first', 'hospital', 'in', 'the', 'area', 'to', 'have', 'this', 'new', '$1', '2', 'millionmachine', 'the', 'chair', 'of', 'the', 'department', 'of', 'radiology', 'at', 'depaul', 'dr', 'harry', 'allen', 'says', ""'for"", 'patients', 'that', 'have', 'repeated', 'ct', 'images', 'because', 'of', 'cancer', 'screening', 'and', 'follow', 'up', 'they', 'end', 'up', 'getting', 'a', 'fairly', 'substantial', 'amount', 'of', 'radiation', 'over', 'their', 'entire', 'lifetime', 'so', 'if', 'you', 'can', 'reduce', 'the', 'individual', 'dose', 'of', 'these', 'images', 'when', 'we', 'obtain', 'these', 'studies', 'then', 'the', 'patient', 'is', 'better', 'off', 'for', 'it', ""'"", 'crisandra', 'hope', 'agrees', 'eight', 'years', 'ago', 'she', 'had', 'breast', 'cancer', 'and', 'she', 'was', 'in', 'remission', 'until', 'last', 'april', 'when', 'she', 'found', 'out', 'it', 'was', 'back', 'and', 'had', 'metastasized', ""'when"", 'you', 'went', 'through', 'whati', 'went', 'through', 'having', 'to', 'take', 'a', 'whole', 'lot', 'of', 'things', 'that', 'involve', 'radiation', 'something', 'like', 'this', 'is', 'good', 'i', 'think', ""it's"", 'fantastic', ""'"", 'she', 'said', 'dr', 'allen', 'says', 'the', 'new', 'machine', 'can', 'obtain', '64', 'images', 'in', 'less', 'than', 'a', 'second', 'and', 'the', 'whole', 'body', '--', 'from', 'head', 'to', 'toe', '--', 'can', 'be', 'imaged', 'in', 'less', 'than', 'ten', 'seconds', 'he', 'saysthe', 'images', 'are', 'about', 'the', 'thickness', 'of', 'a', 'credit', 'card', ""'that"", 'obviously', 'is', 'the', 'most', 'detailed', 'kind', 'of', 'image', 'that', 'you', 'could', 'possible', 'obtain', ""'"", 'he', 'noted', 'for', 'the', 'technicians', 'who', 'use', 'the', 'machine', 'daily', 'like', 'kimberly', 'christian', ""it's"", 'been', 'great', ""'itdoes"", 'a', 'lot', 'of', 'things', 'for', 'you', 'so', ""we're"", 'able', 'to', 'get', 'back', 'to', 'our', 'patients', 'sooner', 'the', 'images', 'are', 'already', 'getting', 'sent', 'over', 'and', 'it', 'just', 'makes', 'the', 'whole', 'process', 'faster', 'from', 'the', 'time', 'they', 'are', 'on', 'the', 'table', 'to', 'the', 'time', 'they', 'leave', 'the', 'department', 'to', 'the', 'time', 'those', 'images', 'go', 'to', 'the', 'radiologist', 'everything', 'is', 'faster', ""'she"", 'explained', 'faster', 'technology', 'means', 'themachine', 'can', 'do', 'a', 'lot', 'of', 'things', 'that', 'older', 'ct', 'machines', ""couldn't"", 'do', 'like', 'evaluate', 'blood', 'vessels', 'in', 'the', 'abdomen', 'pelvis', 'brain', 'and', 'even', 'the', 'heart', ""'the"", 'old', 'ct', 'just', ""wasn't"", 'fast', 'enough', 'to', 'obtain', 'clear', 'images', 'of', 'the', 'heart', 'at', 'all', 'so', 'we', 'need', 'technology', 'of', 'this', 'magnitude', 'to', 'be', 'able', 'to', 'basically', 'stop', 'the', 'motion', 'of', 'the', 'heart', 'to', 'be', 'able', 'to', 'get', 'a', 'clear', 'image', 'of', 'it', ""'dr"", 'allen', 'stated', 'the', 'new', 'ct', 'scannerarrived', 'in', 'may', 'and', 'already', 'almost', '2', '000patients', 'have', 'used', 'it', 'hope', 'adds', ""'that"", 'makes', 'the', 'biggest', 'difference', 'in', 'the', 'world', 'as', 'far', 'as', 'your', 'comfort', 'and', 'making', 'you', 'feel', 'more', 'relaxed', ""'""]","['advanced', 'able', 'improving', 'clarity', 'fairly', 'substantial', 'patient', 'better', 'hope', 'good', 'fantastic', 'kind', 'great', 'able', 'just', 'even', 'heart', 'just', 'heart', 'able', 'heart', 'able', 'hope', 'relaxed']","['low', 'cancer', 'cancer', 'less', 'less', 'obviously', 'blood', 'need']",7.0,2010.0,"norfolk -- new technology is bringing low dose ct imaging to hampton roads  the64-slice ct scanner has advanced software in itthat allows technicians tobe able toreduce radiation exposure by up to 40 percent while improving the image clarity

Chief Paul Neudigate said in a tweet that police got a call about shots fired in the city. He added that the ShotSpotter technology was able to suggest the area where it happened: the 900 block of Diamond Springs Rd. Detectives found shell casings there and entered them into the National Integrated Ballistic Information Network (NIBIN) to search for the person who could be responsible for the crime. 

This could also help officers find suspects who have been involved in other incidents. The ShotSpotter equipment recently became active. It was placed in the Western Bayside area of the city as a way for police to narrow down where a gun was fired, and get notifications about those shootings, in an effort to lower the crime rate.

Residents and business owners in the area were notified by letter about the new equipment, according to Neudigate.

69,Bugged Bins: Local cities tracking your trash,13NewsNow,https://www.13newsnow.com/article/news/local/13news-now-investigates/bugged-bins-local-cities-tracking-your-trash/291-294047372,Norfolk,11/2014,"CHESAPEAKE -- Several cities in Hampton Roads are using advanced computer technology to track their residents' recycling habits.

The technology--radio frequency identification, or RFID for short--is a type of computer chip that uses radio waves to transmit information in real time.

In the case of recycling bins, cities are purchasing bins with RFID tags on them that communicate to a radio antenna each time the bin is dumped into the truck.



In Hampton Roads, the cities of Chesapeake, Norfolk and Suffolk use the technology. The city of Virginia Beach is slowly implementing an RFID program of its own by purchasing new bins outfitted with RFID chips to replace older bins.

At roughly $1.50 per chip, the cities who use RFID technology in their recycling bins say the chips provide a host of benefits at a relatively small cost.

""It does many things for us,"" said Chesapeake Waste Administrator David Thompson. ""One of the biggest things, as far as the city is concerned, is we're able to keep up with the inventory of cans.""

Beyond tracking city-owned cans, Thompson said RFID chips allow his staff to keep track of how many residents are participating in the city's voluntary recycling program. Thompson said the more residents who recycle, the less trash that is hauled to the dump.

""Last year, Chesapeake recycled about 16,700 tons of recycling material and the more we can get into [a recycling bin], the less that goes into [a dump] at $125 a ton,"" Thompson said.

But some residents--many of whom may not even known their recycling habits are being monitored--may feel uneasy about the city's ability to collect data at their doorstep.

Jeremy Gillula, a technologist for the non-profit Electronic Frontier Foundation, said putting RFID chips in recycling bins is a less-intrusive use of the technology than what other industries are doing.

""It sits, you know, either at the curb or you bring it in the garage or up the driveway. So, given that, there doesn't seem to be a whole lot of concern for the presence of the RFID tag,"" Gillula said.

Instead, the real concern, Gillula said, was in how cities are handling the data once it is collected.

""Is it going to be shared with other government agencies? Or with companies?"" he asked. ""That's always a question when you have data being collected.""

Thompson said that although he has the ability to request data about individual households' recycling habits, he does not get that information. Instead, he said, he looks at data about individual neighborhoods and the entire city.

We do go in sometimes and look at certain neighborhoods where we're not seeing the number that we would like to see,"" Thompson explained. ""But as far as looking at address by address, we don't do that. We don't want to be that intrusive.""

Similarly, a spokesman for the city of Suffolk said the city does not request data about individual households, either, even though that data is collected and could be provided.

Lori Crouch, a city of Norfolk spokeswoman, said Norfolk tracks participation through quarterly reports it receives from TFC but does not regularly get household-specific data.

""RFID tags also track actual resident participation in the recycling program, providing data for efficient use of targeted outreach and advertising efforts,"" Crouch said. Nikolas Larum manages the hauling operation for TFC Recycling, the company contracted by most cities in Hampton Roads to collect recycling.

Larum said the RFID technology helps him and his staff track the progress of collection trucks as they work in the field and improves driver efficiency by allowing them to easily remember where their last pick-up was.

""For our purposes, it's great because we can see the progress of our truck and we can see if the cart has been serviced,"" Larum explained.

Larum pushed back on the suggestion that the data his company tracks through the RFID chips is invasive.

""We're collecting the primary habit or if the person put their cart out to the curb,"" he said.

David Thompson, the waste administrator in Chesapeake, echoed a similar sentiment.

""Our goal is to try and help the city pull more tonnage out of the waste stream and save money,"" Thompson said. ""That's the goal. It's not to see who is doing what."" Larum also pointed to a program operated in partnership with his company called Recycle Perks that allows customers to receive benefits tied to how frequently the recycle.
The program requires residents to provide detailed customer information and consent to having their recycling habits be tracked.

A spokeswoman for Recycle Perks, which is a sister company of TFC Recycling, said the program has been a hit with customers.","['chesapeake', '--', 'several', 'cities', 'in', 'hampton', 'roads',

'waste', 'waste']",11.0,2014.0,"chesapeake -- several cities in hampton roads are using advanced computer technology to track their residents' recycling habits 

the technology--radio frequency identification  or rfid for short--is a type of computer chip that uses radio waves to transmit information in real time 

in the case of recycling bins  cities are purchasing bins with rfid tags on them that communicate to a radio antenna each time the bin is dumped into the truck 



in hampton roads  the cities of chesapeake  norfolk and suffolk use the technology  the city of virginia beach is slowly implementing an rfid program of its own by purchasing new bins outfitted with rfid chips to replace older bins 

at roughly $1 50 per chip  the cities who use rfid technology in their recycling bins say the chips provide a host of benefits at a relatively small cost 

""it does many things for us "" said chesapeake waste administrator david thompson  ""one of the biggest things  as far as the city is concerned  is we're able to keep up with the inventory of cans ""

beyond tracking city-owned cans  thompson said rfid chips allow his staff to keep track of how many residents are participating in the city's voluntary recycling program  thompson said the more residents who recycle  the less trash that is hauled to the dump 

""last year  chesapeake recycled about 16 700 tons of recycling material and the more we can get into [a recycling bin]  the less that goes into [a dump] at $125 a ton "" thompson said 

but some residents--many of whom may not even known their recycling habits are being monitored--may feel uneasy about the city's ability to collect data at their doorstep 

jeremy gillula  a technologist for the non-profit electronic frontier foundation  said putting rfid chips in recycling bins is a less-intrusive use of the technology than what other industries are doing 

""it sits  you know  either at the curb or you bring it in the garage or up the driveway  so  given that  there doesn't seem to be a whole lot of concern for the presence of the rfid tag "" gillula said 

instead  the real concern  gillula said  was in how cities are handling the data once it is collected 

""is it going to be shared with other government agencies  or with companies "" he asked  ""that's always a question when you have data being collected ""

thompson said that although he has the ability to request data about individual households' recycling habits  he does not get that information  instead  he said  he looks at data about individual neighborhoods and the entire city

(AP) - Some of the world's most sophisticated tunnel technology will be used to expand the Hampton Roads Bridge-Tunnel.

The Daily Press reported Thursday that contractors will use a massive machine to dig through the soil under Hampton Roads Harbor.

The digging will be a change from the previous method used to build or expand bridge-tunnels in coastal Virginia. That method involved submersing prefabricated pieces of tunnel into a trench. Contractors will add a new bridge-tunnel parallel to the existing ones that carry Interstate 64 from Norfolk to Hampton.

The project will accommodate more traffic and will cost $3 billion-plus. The state expects to choose a contractor for the project early next year.

72,Work underway to keep cybersecurity talent from leaving Hampton Roads,13NewsNow,https://www.13newsnow.com/article/news/local/work-underway-to-keep-cybersecurity-talent-from-leaving-hampton-roads/291-212009187,Norfolk,05/2016,"VIRGINIA BEACH, Va. (WVEC) -- Teenagers are being taught to hack... but not in order to commit a crime. It's so they know how to defend against cyber attacks. ""We actually hack in order to defend the hack, but it’s all ethical hacking,"" said Linda Lavender, an instructor at Advance Technical Center in Virginia Beach.

But after learning those skills at Advance Techjnology Center, Hampton Roads lost Chris Hultin to a better paying job Texas.

""There’s not nearly as much in the private technology sector in Hampton Roads,"" said Hultin, a former student at ATC who honed his skills under Lavender.

Just like our service members on the front lines of combat, these teenagers are our new soldiers in the cyber-war, where there were an estimated 160 successful cyber-attacks per week in 2015! That was up from 50 per week in 2010, according to data collected by the Ponemon Institute.

""These are the attackers who are launching the attack as you can see going across,"" said current ATC student Cory Petko.

The 16-year-old showed us a map that shows real-time cyber attacks from China launched against the U.S.

But for the 475 students that graduate from ATC every year, getting a job here may not be so easy.

""Are the benefits and the pay here? Maybe, no,"" said Lavender.

Better incentives such as more money were offered to Hultin, who took a job in Austin.

According to a report that was released last week, Austin is one of the nation's 20 largest cities that saw their population grow last year, blustered in part by the cybersecurity industry.

""We’ve got over 200,000 un-filled cyber jobs. Virginia alone has 18,000 and these jobs pay an average salary of $88,000,"" said Sen. Mark Warner, who has been working to make Hampton Roads and the Commonwealth attractive to Cybersecurity companies.

Learning the skills for that type of job isn't only happening at ATC, but also Old Dominion University's cybersecurity program.

Norfolk State University got a visit from Vice President Joe Biden last year, after it won a $25 million grant for its cybersecurity program.

On the local level, Norfolk city leaders voted to offer tax incentives to lure tech companies last week. Chesapeake, Suffolk and Newport News have similar programs and so does Virginia Beach, which is home to the cybersecurity firm IntellecTechs. ""Because we have the talent down here, we could certainly make a good story to have those jobs down there,"" said owner Jeri Prophet, who notes that a regional effort would be greatly beneficial to the Hampton Roads area.

That regional push recently started with help Rob Hegedus.

The CEO of Suffolk-based cyber risk management company Serra-Brynn is part of a newly formed group called ""Cyber Protection Resources.""

""From an advertisement perspective and from a lobbying perspective, they’re situated very well to be able to kind of demonstrate to the rest of the world that we have the talent here. And that we can absorb some of the additional work that’s coming up,"" said Hegedus, whose company was ranked as one of the top 10 cybersecurity companies in the country and 16th in the world.

While the regional effort ramps out, Virginia Beach city leaders are trying to lure what they call a major cyersecurity company to the city.

Negotiations are still ongoing, so the name of that company hasn't been released just yet.

""there’s not nearly as much in the private technology sector in hampton roads "" said hultin  a former student at atc who honed his skills under lavender

73,Tool gives caregivers insight into dementia,13NewsNow,https://www.13newsnow.com/article/news/tool-gives-caregivers-insight-into-dementia/291-119446971,Norfolk,04/2016,"“She can't tell me when she's in pain,” Priscilla Saunders says about her mother who was diagnosed with dementia. “She can't tell me when she's thirsty. She can't tell me any of those things, so I have to be able to watch her just like an infant.” HAMPTON, Va. (WVEC) -- Technology, available right here in Hampton Roads, is now helping caregivers get insight into their loved ones' dementia, which often creates debilitating memory loss, confusion and personality changes.

Now, people caring for those suffering can truly understand what's going on. Here's the concept behind that Virtual Dementia Tour: Imagine the difference you could make if you fully understood the physical, emotional and cognitive changes dementia is causing in your loved one.

There are days Priscilla Saunders doesn't recognize the mother she is so close to.

“Her personality is nothing like it used to be,” she described.

Diagnosed with Alzheimer's and dementia in 2009, Thelma Hill's cognitive abilities have declined steadily. She's not alone; statistics show every 67 seconds someone in the United States develops Alzheimer's. For Priscilla, like many caregivers, the disease has created a role reversal of sorts.

“She can't tell me when she's in pain,” Priscilla explained. “She can't tell me when she's thirsty. She can't tell me any of those things, so I have to be able to watch her just like an infant.”

She hesitates to put into words just how difficult the loss is for her.

“To see the personal things that no longer mean anything to them just is devastating,” the loving daughter lamented.

Even though Priscilla and her brother visit their mother every single day, she didn't know, she really couldn't know, exactly what the almost-92-year-old is going through.

So when Commonwealth Assisted Living and Memory Care in Hampton, where Thelma lives, offered the Virtual Dementia Tour, Priscilla thought it would be helpful.

For proprietary reasons, we're not allowed to show you inside the room where the tour is given, but we can explain how it works. Inserts with raised ridges and spikes go in your shoes. They simulate nerve damage in your feet when you're walking. They're really uncomfortable and even painful to have in your shoes.

Work gloves simulate how your hands become less sensitive as you age. They also can mimic nerve damage and arthritis in people's hands as they get older and they make it really difficult to pick up things and feel around where you are. The tour also utilizes classes. They simulate macular degeneration and a loss of eyesight as you get older. It's very difficult to see in your peripheral vision as well as straight ahead in some cases as you're looking through these classes.

Headphones are also worn throughout the entire tour. Playing in them, there is a constant background noise, including white noise and a random loud siren or alarm. There's this constant stimulation of your hearing and that's supposed to simulate the loss of hearing and just the background noises that can distract and unnerve somebody as they get older.

During the tour, Priscilla says she was disoriented, unnerved and in pain.

“I think the tour made me realize that all the noise and everything around them just confuses them,” she told us. “I think it's going to make me have more patience with her. I will always think back to that moment.”

Experts say caregivers need to think back to that moment, and remember for a loved one with dementia, that moment is their entire life.

“You knew someone was coming to get you soon,” Regional Director of Programming Jerry Lynn Daniels added. “For a person with dementia, there isn't a light at the end of the tunnel. No one's coming to get them and remove them from that room. That's what they feel all the time.”","['“she', ""can't"", 'tell', 'me', 'when', ""she's"", 'in', 'pain', '”', 'priscilla', 'saunders', 'says', 'about', 'her', 'mother', 'who', 'was', 'diagnosed',

75,Gloucester A&I exhibit now on display,Gloucester-Mathews Gazette-Journal,https://www.gazettejournal.net/gloucester-ai-exhibit-now-on-display/,Gloucester,02/2022,"The Gloucester Museum of History is now featuring a new exhibit on the history of the Gloucester Agricultural and Industrial School, also known as the Cappahosic Academy.

Gloucester A&I was an African American school that operated in Gloucester for 45 years and provided students with quality learning environment and encouraged students to pursue higher education.

Gloucester Museums Coordinator Robert Kelly said the exhibit was largely possible thanks to the efforts of Drs. Dorothy Cooke and Wesley Wilson, Bobby Ray and Deborah Billups who he said originally pitched the idea for the exhibit highlighting the African American school.

The exhibit features a wall of informative graphics by Mellen Street Creative, Hampton, and artifacts such as a diploma, ledgers and the school’s massive bell. The 309 pound, 24-inch diameter bell is an eye-catching piece for the exhibit and is on loan to the museum in honor of John DeHardit.

The bell was cast by McShane Foundry in Baltimore in 1891. Kelly said the records from the company show only one bell of its size made that year was the bell for Gloucester A&I. Kelly said the bell is a tangible artifact that anyone who’s been in school can relate to and understand. The bell had to be large and loud enough to reach classes and students across its 150-acre campus.

Another artifact is a book report from 1930, which is on a French book and is entirely written in French. One of the school ledgers on display shows the tracking of tuition for students enrolled, and how some were paying. It shows that some students worked at the school in the summer to pay their way through school.

Kelly said the documents and records provide a more personal connection to the school and those who attended. The goal of the school was for its students to graduate and pursue higher education. He said one example of this was Virginia L. Murray, who after graduating from the school then attended Howard University and New York University. She also taught in Albemarle, where today a school is named in her honor.

Gloucester A&I was founded by William Weaver in the 1880s with assistance from T.C. Walker, said Kelly. In 1891, the school’s financial struggles caused it to be purchased by the American Missionary Association which provided the institute consistent funding, allowing it to grow.

In 1899, the AMA replaced Weaver with Gloucester A&I’s then-assistant principal William Price. Kelly said Price along with his wife Carrie advanced the studies of the academy, introducing more courses in the humanities and science focused on farming. The changes made the school more well-rounded and attractive to students from all along the Chesapeake Bay.

Kelly said the records show students from Maryland and Washington, D.C., would take ferries to the port at Cappahosic. He said building the school only a mile from a steamboat-accessible pier allowed for the school’s reach to extend far past Gloucester. He said advertisements for the school at the time often mentioned how accessible the school was.

The notoriety of school attracted the attention of prominent civil rights activist Frederick Douglass, who delivered the school’s 1894 commencement speech.

The height of enrollment for the school was in 1925 with 159 students, said Kelly. Despite its success, the school was abruptly closed in 1933, an effect of the Great Depression. The AMA could no longer afford to support the school in the 1930s, and the once-prominent school was left to deteriorate.

Kelly said he hopes the new exhibit will attract people with their own stories of the school. He said the school’s existence is known throughout the county but isn’t well known. He said he would like the community to provide the museum with more stories and knowledge of the black school.

is now featuring a new exhibit on the history of the gloucester agricultural and industrial school  also known as the cappahosic academy 

gloucester a&i was an african american school that operated in gloucester for 45 years and provided students with quality learning environment and encouraged students to pursue higher education 

gloucester museums coordinator robert kelly said the exhibit was largely possible thanks to the efforts of drs  dorothy cooke and wesley wilson  bobby ray and deborah billups who he said originally pitched the idea for the exhibit highlighting the african american school 

the exhibit features a wall of informative graphics by mellen street creative  hampton  and artifacts such as a diploma  ledgers and the school’s massive bell  the 309 pound  24-inch diameter bell is an eye-catching piece for the exhibit and is on loan to the museum in honor of john dehardit 

the bell was cast by mcshane foundry in baltimore in 1891  kelly said the records from the company show only one bell of its size made that year was the bell for gloucester a&i  kelly said the bell is a tangible artifact that anyone who’s been in school can relate to and understand  the bell had to be large and loud enough to reach classes and students across its 150-acre campus 

another artifact is a book report from 1930  which is on a french book and is entirely written in french  one of the school ledgers on display shows the tracking of tuition for students enrolled  and how some were paying  it shows that some students worked at the school in the summer to pay their way through school 

kelly said the documents and records provide a more personal connection to the school and those who attended  the goal of the school was for its students to graduate and pursue higher education  he said one example of this was virginia l  murray  who after graduating from the school then attended howard university and new york university  she also taught in albemarle  where today a school is named in her honor 

gloucester a&i was founded by william weaver in the 1880s with assistance from t c  walker  said kelly  in 1891  the school’s financial struggles caused it to be purchased by the american missionary association which provided the institute consistent funding  allowing it to grow 

in 1899  the ama replaced weaver with gloucester a&i’s then-assistant principal william price  kelly said price along with his wife carrie advanced the studies of the academy  introducing more courses in the humanities and science focused on farming  the changes made the school more well-rounded and attractive to students from all along the chesapeake bay 

kelly said the records show students from maryland and washington  d c   would take ferries to the port at cappahosic  he said building the school only a mile from a steamboat-accessible pier allowed for the school’s reach to extend far past gloucester  he said advertisements for the school at the time often mentioned how accessible the school was

77,Renowned sculptor to kick off Gloucester Arts Festival,Gloucester-Mathews Gazette-Journal,https://www.gazettejournal.net/renowned-sculptor-to-kick-off-gloucester-arts-festival/,Gloucester,04/2022,"Globally renowned sculptor Adrian Landon will exhibit at this year’s Gloucester Arts Festival, kicking off the monthlong festival with the installation of four of his sculptures on Main Street, including the kinetic piece, “The Mechanical Horse.” The festival will be held in June at various locations throughout the county.

Elizabeth Blackney, executive director of The Cook Foundation, which sponsors the festival, said that to have Landon exhibit locally “is humbling and thrilling.” He will have just completed his installation of his critically acclaimed “Wings of Glory” at Chatsworth House in Devonshire, England, for the Radical Horizons exhibit.

“Art transforms and transports us,” said Blackney. “Art informs and inspires communal experiences … Visionary artists ignite new generations of artists, engineers, thinkers, and community leaders.”

Landon was born and raised in New York City, “scribbling and eating Play-doh as a toddler,” said a press release. He attended the Academy of Arts in San Francisco in 2008, but after completing one year of industrial design, he left.

In 2009, as “a proud college dropout,” Landon’s journey as a sculptor began at the Art Students League of New York. He developed his initial body of work in the New York area, where in 2014 he completed his first Mechanical Horse and began to show his work nationally and internationally.

In 2019, Landon received the Honorarium Grant from Burning Man to make “Wings of Glory,” a giant mechanical Pegasus, his largest sculpture to date. He then went to the Buffalo Creek Art Center in Gardnerville, Nevada, to “build the impossible,” and currently lives in Reno, Nevada. He makes art at the Generator, a communal maker space.

The Cook Foundation has worked tirelessly for the past 23 years to expand access to the arts in Gloucester, said the release, adding, “through partnerships with the Virginia Symphony Orchestra, Plein Air artists, muralists, and sculptors like Seward Johnson, and now Adrian Landon, we are grateful to give back to this historic community and create opportunities to enjoy and benefit from all the arts.”

78,Juneteenth celebration goes ahead with venue change,Gloucester-Mathews Gazette-Journal,https://www.gazettejournal.net/juneteenth-celebration-goes-ahead-with-venue-change/,Gloucester,06/2022,"In spite of concerns prompted by a troubling post on social media days before the event, Sunday afternoon’s Juneteenth celebration in Gloucester went ahead, with a change in venue, as people gathered at The First United Baptist Church at White Marsh for this year’s “Celebration of Freedom, Family, Faith and Future.”

Juneteenth commemorates June 19, 1865, the day that enslaved people in Galveston, Texas, learned that they were, in fact, free. The following year, freed slaves had their first celebration of what is now known as Juneteenth, and it has been celebrated ever since. Juneteenth was recognized both a state and federal holiday in 2021.


PHOTO BY STEVE GREAVES During Sunday’s Juneteenth program, Gloucester County Sheriff’s Office Sgt. Jo Hughes surprised 8-year-old Gloucester resident Christian Montaque with a gift, a rare, solid plastic, “Junior Deputy” badge, to honor his good sportsmanship and thoughtfulness, after he’d defeated a couple of deputies in a cornhole game under shade trees and, on his own initiative, vanished into the church to return minutes later with bottles of water for all the officers. “He was truly thoughtful, as well as a great sportsman, very courteous to his competitors,” Hughes said.
As keynote speaker Dr. Cassandra Newby-Alexander pointed out, that date, while significant, is just one in a long and continuing process.

“Freedom is a process and we all need to come together to understand that freedom did not happen with one date and it is a journey that people are still on,” the Dean of the College of Liberal Arts at Norfolk State University said.

This year’s event was fun filled with inspiring speakers, live music, words of prayer, drawings for prizes and a multitude of vendors and exhibits for attendees to experience.

“We cannot do this all alone—we all need to come together,” Dr. Newby-Alexander told the crowd, as the nation continues the process of freedom and reconciliation. Part of the healing and coming together as a nation, she suggested, involves a true accounting of our past. “This is all our history and it cannot be hidden,” she said.
This year’s event was sponsored by the Woodville Rosenwald School Foundation, the Gloucester Union Relief Association, CircleUp Middle Peninsula and First United Baptist.

Throughout the event, attendees clapped and sang along with the music performed throughout the event. All in attendance came together and sang “Lift Every Voice and Sing” in unison and they all seemed to have enjoyed themselves. Some of the musicians who performed were the musical group George Robinson and Friends, soloist Charles McKeller, soloist D’Moria Garcia, musical group The Gresham Brothers, soloist Robert Brown and The Gloucester/Mathews Men’s Chorus.

There were words of prayer. Sister Maxine Trower delivered the invocation at the gathering and the Rev. Vincent Pryor also gave words of prayer as well.

There were drawings throughout the day where attendees were given prizes such as beautiful flowers and gift cards to local businesses in the county.

Attendees also engaged well with the informational exhibits and vendors at the event. Many signed up for notifications from the organizations that were there and took pamphlets that were provided. They also were given food, refreshments and little gifts to take with them. Attendees were also buying products from some of the vendors, including some Black-owned businesses in attendance.

Social media post

The location of the celebration was changed at the last minute because a possible threat of violence was posted on a local Facebook page.

Juneteenth committee member Sheila Crowley explained that when the comment was made on Facebook, the original venue, Flat Iron Crossroads, decided to cancel its entire weekend of Juneteenth festivities out of an abundance of caution. Events had also been planned for Friday and Saturday at Flat Iron Crossroads; some of those performances were incorporated into Sunday’s program.

However, the Juneteenth Celebration 2022 committee refused to be intimidated, said the Rev. E. Randolph Graham, who heads up the Juneteenth celebration committee, and instead changed the venue to The First United Baptist Church, where he serves as pastor and where the event had been held in years past. A Gloucester County Sheriff’s Office deputy and a Virginia State Trooper were both on site.

“The committee decided we could do it and do it safely at the church, so we moved forward, with police presence,” said Mr. Graham. “I’m 72, and I’ve been threatened before. I’m fully aware that many threats are just threats, and that sometimes they’re made by persons of influence and generate copycats. But with law enforcement’s presence, we were comfortable.”

Major Ryan Cookson of the GCSO said last week that the office, in consultation with the Gloucester Commonwealth Attorney’s Office and the Federal Bureau of Investigation, had determined that the comment made on social media was not a specific or credible threat, but was rather a distasteful comment.

The specific comment, which was made on a post about the upcoming celebration, stated, “…bet it ends abruptly due to a shooting or some other act of violence.”

Cookson said that the lieutenant in charge of the investigation into the comment conducted an interview with the subject, who said he was joking around and didn’t realize he would be taken seriously. A background check was done on the person, as well.

“We’re not trying to downplay this,” said Cookson. “Any time anybody makes such a comment it’s concerning, particularly in the current environment. But we have to pay attention to how we react, as well, because people do make stupid comments.”

Gloucester NAACP president Brenda Dixon wasn’t satisfied with that explanation. She said she believed that if a Black person had made a similar comment, “they’d be in jail.”

“When the sheriff said the man was just kidding around, it made me hotter,” said Dixon. “It was serious enough that the legal team at Flat Iron said it was a huge liability … The guy in Texas made a threat on social media and the guy in Buffalo made a threat on social media … It was totally disruptive, and it created fear in the elderly community.”","['in', 'spite', 'of', 'concerns', 'prompted',

went ahead  with a change in venue  as people gathered at the first united baptist church at white marsh for this year’s “celebration of freedom  family  faith and future ”

juneteenth commemorates june 19  1865  the day that enslaved people in galveston  texas  learned that they were  in fact  free  the following year  freed slaves had their first celebration of what is now known as juneteenth  and it has been celebrated ever since  juneteenth was recognized both a state and federal holiday in 2021

as keynote speaker dr  cassandra newby-alexander pointed out  that date  while significant  is just one in a long and continuing process 

“freedom is a process and we all need to come together to understand that freedom did not happen with one date and it is a journey that people are still on ” the dean of the college of liberal arts at norfolk state university said 

this year’s event was fun filled with inspiring speakers  live music  words of prayer  drawings for prizes and a multitude of vendors and exhibits for attendees to experience 

“we cannot do this all alone—we all need to come together ” dr  newby-alexander told the crowd  as the nation continues the process of freedom and reconciliation  part of the healing and coming together as a nation  she suggested  involves a true accounting of our past  “this is all our history and it cannot be hidden ” she said

82,Coach’s Comedy Club show to benefit West Mathews Community League,Gloucester-Mathews Gazette-Journal,https://www.gazettejournal.net/coachs-comedy-club-show-to-benefit-west-mathews-community-league/,Gloucester,04/2018,"Coach’s Comedy Club, the third annual comedy show to benefit the West Mathews Community League Peninsula School at Bohannon, will be held at 7 p.m. on Saturday, April 14 at the Harry Ward Auditorium at Mathews High School.

The evening of stand-up comedy features Coach Tom Holaday of Mathews as master of ceremonies, along with comics Rob Reibold and David Beck.

Holaday, who retired from Mathews High School as a teacher and wrestling coach, started working in comedy clubs in 1992 “inspired by the joy and excitement he experienced getting laughs at high school banquets, assemblies, pep rallies and fundraisers,” according to a release. Holaday now tours clubs and speaks at corporate functions about his life as a father, teacher and coach.

“Everyone has a family, went to high school, and enjoys sports (or at least is married to someone who does). All can relate to the clean comedy of Coach Holaday’s life stories,” the release stated.

For more than 20 years, Reibold has been bringing his brand of comedy to stages all over the country. He has worked with famed comedians Lewis Black, Eddie Griffin and Patton Oswalt, as well as five cast members from “Saturday Night Live.” Among the venues where he has performed include Las Vegas’ “Comedy Stop at the Trop,” Funny Bone Comedy Clubs, and The Improvs from coast-to-coast.

Beck, a native Virginian, now resides in Springfield, Missouri. Originally starting out as an observational comedian, Beck has grown into a more versatile higher energy style which includes quick one liners. He has entertained audiences around the county, and recently around the world, with a tour entertaining the U.S. military in Japan and South Korea.

Not limited to just comedy clubs, Beck has a resume full of radio and television appearances. He has been heard on Fox Sports radio, and the nationally syndicated “Bob & Tom Show.” He has even ventured into the serious side of television with roles in Discovery Channel programming, such as The Prosecutors, New Detectives, and The FBI Files.

Money raised from the April 14 show will be used to replace windows in the historic Peninsula School building, which serves as a community center. Forty big original windows and six other smaller windows need replacing, according to West Mathews Community League president Al DeWitt.

“They’ve gotten past the point of no return,” he said of the windows. “They can’t be fixed.”

Tickets will be available at the door, as well as from WMCL members. This Saturday from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m., the group will sell tickets in front of Best Value supermarket.","['coach’s', 'comedy', 'club', 'the', 'third', 'annual', 'comedy', 'show', 'to', 'benefit', 'the', 'west', 'mathews', 'community', 'league', 'peninsula', 'school', 'at', 'bohannon', 'will', 'be', 'held', 'at', '7', 'p', 'm', 'on', 'saturday', 'april', '14', 'at', 'the', 'harry', 'ward', 'auditorium', 'at', 'mathews', 'high', 'school', 'the', 'evening', 'of', 'stand-up', 'comedy', 'features', 'coach', 'tom', 'holaday', 'of', 'mathews', 'as', 'master', 'of', 'ceremonies', 'along', 'with', 'comics', 'rob', 'reibold', 'and', 'david', 'beck', 'holaday', 'who', 'retired', 'from', 'mathews', 'high', 'school', 'as', 'a', 'teacher', 'and', 'wrestling', 'coach', 'started', 'working', 'in', 'comedy', 'clubs', 'in', '1992', '“inspired', 'by', 'the', 'joy', 'and', 'excitement', 'he', 'experienced', 'getting', 'laughs', 'at', 'high', 'school', 'banquets', 'assemblies', 'pep', 'rallies', 'and', 'fundraisers', '”', 'according', 'to', 'a', 'release', 'holaday', 'now', 'tours', 'clubs', 'and', 'speaks', 'at', 'corporate', 'functions', 'about', 'his', 'life', 'as', 'a', 'father', 'teacher', 'and', 'coach', '“everyone', 'has', 'a', 'family', 'went', 'to', 'high', 'school', 'and', 'enjoys', 'sports', '(or', 'at', 'least', 'is', 'married', 'to', 'someone', 'who', 'does)', 'all', 'can', 'relate', 'to', 'the', 'clean', 'comedy', 'of', 'coach', 'holaday’s', 'life', 'stories', '”', 'the', 'release', 'stated', 'for', 'more', 'than', '20', 'years', 'reibold', 'has', 'been', 'bringing', 'his', 'brand', 'of', 'comedy', 'to', 'stages', 'all', 'over', 'the', 'country', 'he', 'has', 'worked', 'with', 'famed', 'comedians', 'lewis', 'black', 'eddie', 'griffin', 'and', 'patton', 'oswalt', 'as', 'well', 'as', 'five', 'cast', 'members', 'from', '“saturday', 'night', 'live', '”', 'among', 'the', 'venues', 'where', 'he', 'has', 'performed', 'include', 'las', 'vegas’', '“comedy', 'stop', 'at', 'the', 'trop', '”', 'funny', 'bone', 'comedy', 'clubs', 'and', 'the', 'improvs', 'from', 'coast-to-coast', 'beck', 'a', 'native', 'virginian', 'now', 'resides', 'in', 'springfield', 'missouri', 'originally', 'starting', 'out', 'as', 'an', 'observational', 'comedian', 'beck', 'has', 'grown', 'into', 'a', 'more', 'versatile', 'higher', 'energy', 'style', 'which', 'includes', 'quick', 'one', 'liners', 'he', 'has', 'entertained', 'audiences', 'around', 'the', 'county', 'and', 'recently', 'around', 'the', 'world', 'with', 'a', 'tour', 'entertaining', 'the', 'u', 's', 'military', 'in', 'japan', 'and', 'south', 'korea', 'not', 'limited', 'to', 'just', 'comedy', 'clubs', 'beck', 'has', 'a', 'resume', 'full', 'of', 'radio', 'and', 'television', 'appearances', 'he', 'has', 'been', 'heard', 'on', 'fox', 'sports', 'radio', 'and', 'the', 'nationally', 'syndicated', '“bob', '&', 'tom', 'show', '”', 'he', 'has', 'even', 'ventured', 'into', 'the', 'serious', 'side', 'of', 'television', 'with', 'roles', 'in', 'discovery', 'channel', 'programming', 'such', 'as', 'the', 'prosecutors', 'new', 'detectives', 'and', 'the', 'fbi', 'files', 'money', 'raised', 'from', 'the', 'april', '14', 'show', 'will', 'be', 'used', 'to', 'replace', 'windows', 'in', 'the', 'historic', 'peninsula', 'school', 'building', 'which', 'serves', 'as', 'a', 'community', 'center', 'forty', 'big', 'original', 'windows', 'and', 'six', 'other', 'smaller', 'windows', 'need', 'replacing', 'according', 'to', 'west', 'mathews', 'community', 'league', 'president', 'al', 'dewitt', '“they’ve', 'gotten', 'past', 'the', 'point', 'of', 'no', 'return', '”', 'he', 'said', 'of', 'the', 'windows', '“they', 'can’t', 'be', 'fixed', '”', 'tickets', 'will', 'be', 'available', 'at', 'the', 'door', 'as', 'well', 'as', 'from', 'wmcl', 'members', 'this', 'saturday', 'from', '10', 'a', 'm', 'to', '2', 'p', 'm', 'the', 'group', 'will', 'sell', 'tickets', 'in', 'front', 'of', 'best', 'value', 'supermarket']","['benefit', 'will', 'master', 'joy', 'excitement', 'experienced', 'clean', 'famed', 'well', 'live', 'funny', 'versatile', 'entertaining', 'just', 'even', 'will', 'historic', 'original', 'will', 'well', 'will']","['comedy', 'comedy', 'comedy', 'comedy', 'least', 'comedy', 'comedy', 'black', 'comedy', 'limited', 'comedy', 'serious', 'need']",4.0,2018.0,"coach’s comedy club  the third annual comedy show to benefit the west mathews community league peninsula school at bohannon  will be held at 7 p m  on saturday  april 14 at the harry ward auditorium at mathews high school

83,Fixed broadband equipment arriving; network buildout underway,Gloucester-Mathews Gazette-Journal,https://www.gazettejournal.net/fixed-broadband-equipment-arriving-network-buildout-underway/,Gloucester,05/2022,"Despite international and national supply chain issues, fixed wireless broadband equipment is arriving, and the network buildout is underway.

Open Broadband is working on the first phase of the local project in both Mathews and Gloucester counties, outfitting towers with antennas, receivers, and other new technology to help meet distance and speed goals for the internet service.

Much of the legwork of this project is being completed by the Gloucester and Mathews VATI (Virginia Telecommunication Initiative) committees, which work in concert to expand broadband in underserved areas, fulfilling all requirements of VATI grant funding. Both localities are working towards ubiquitous broadband access throughout their counties, according to a release from the Gloucester Department of Community Engagement and Public Information.

The VATI committee is made up of stakeholders, county leadership and IT professionals, both inside and outside the two counties, who have helped to guide the application and implementation processes. This grant was awarded in 2021 and will help build out a new fixed wireless network with North Carolina-based ISP Open Broadband. The grant will expand broadband access to 313 “serviceable units,” including 19 businesses, with 131 addresses located in Gloucester, two in Middlesex and 180 in Mathews.

For more information on the VATI grant, and broadband information in Gloucester County, residents can go to the Broadband Hub at https://gloucester-broadband-gcgis.hub.arcgis.com.

85,Mathews takes a big step in broadband affordability,Gloucester-Mathews Gazette-Journal,https://www.gazettejournal.net/mathews-takes-a-big-step-in-broadband-affordability/,Gloucester,07/2022,"The good news about broadband in Mathews County just keeps coming.

Mathews Broadband Advisory Board chair Judy Rowe announced to county supervisors Tuesday night that the broadband affordability mandate she received when her advisory board was organized in 2019 is on the cusp of being met.

Rowe got word earlier this week that the Federal Communications Commission’s Affordable Connectivity Program will soon be available for eligible Mathews residents. The program provides a discount of up to $30 per month toward broadband service for eligible households, she said, and Breezeline and Open Broadband, two broadband providers in the county, are both participants in the program.

In addition, said Rowe, Breezeline is participating in the Virginia Telecommunications Initiative’s Line Extension Customer Assistance Program (LECAP), which assists eligible households with up to $3,000 of the cost of extending broadband lines down long driveways. Funding for the program comes from the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021.

“We’ve been going after affordability since we started,” said Rowe during a telephone interview. “I cannot believe these opportunities … The possibilities are just extraordinary.”

According to a handout Rowe shared, a federal qualifying household is one that meets at least one of the following criteria: has an income at or below 200 percent of the federal poverty guidelines; participates in such assistance programs as SNAP, Medicaid, Federal Public Housing Assistance, SSI, WIC, or Lifeline; meets the eligibility criteria for a participating broadband provider’s existing low-income program; or is approved to receive benefits under the free and reduced-priced school lunch or breakfast program, including through the USDA Community Eligibility Provision.

Rowe explained that the last two criteria are particularly important to Mathews. Since Mathews County has a poverty level that makes it eligible for free and reduced-price lunches and breakfasts for all of its students, she said that every Mathews household with a child attending public school will qualify for the broadband service discount of $30 per month.

In addition, Breezeline has recently created a low-income program for its customers, she said, and the price point for that service, coupled with the discount, will essentially make broadband free for any Mathews County Public School student who has Breezeline for a provider. Open Broadband is considering such a program, as well, she said.

A second benefit under the Affordable Connectivity Program that Rowe said will not involve her board is the provision of up to a $100 discount per eligible household on a one-time purchase of a computer, laptop or tablet, as long as the household contributes between $10 and $50 toward that purchase. The Affordable Connectivity Program is also available to people who participate in certain Tribal specific programs and those who received a Federal Pell Grant during the current award year.

Rowe said that those interested in the Affordable Connectivity Program should apply for the assistance online at www.affordableconnectivity.gov.
But households without internet shouldn’t be discouraged, she said. The Broadband Advisory Board is coordinating efforts to assist residents with their applications. People will be available to help out during this year’s Market Days, at public schools in Mathews on book day, and at Mathews Memorial Library on an ongoing basis. There will be other opportunities, as well, said Rowe, and those will be announced when the dates and locations are confirmed.

For residents who live down long lanes that exceed their internet service provider’s standard connection drop length, the online LECAP eligibility map shows that all households in Mathews with incomes of up to $89,066 are eligible for assistance of up to $3,000, while in some zip codes, households with incomes of up to $133,599 are eligible. According to a booklet put out by LECAP, the cost of extending lines down long driveways can run up to as much as $25,000, depending on the distance.

Rowe said she’s excited about all the opportunities that have become available to provide broadband to Mathews residents at an affordable price.

“We’ve been talking about these programs because we knew they were around, but it all came out last week,” she said. “It’s so exciting because it really is the affordable piece.”

The classes will be held from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. Saturday and Sunday, for a total of 32 hours of instruction.

“The course will introduce you to the technology involved in wireless internet via radio waves,” said Steward.

RCC’s Workforce Program Developer Kelly Clifton said the cost for the four-day class is $699, but all costs will be covered by a grant. All students have to do is fill out the registration form. No money is required.

Steward said that class size is limited, and the class is expected to fill up fast, so those interested should contact Clifton at kclifton@rappahannock.edu or 804-758-6794 as soon as possible.

mathews broadband advisory board chair judy rowe announced to county supervisors tuesday night that the broadband affordability mandate she received when her advisory board was organized in 2019 is on the cusp of being met 

rowe got word earlier this week that the federal communications commission’s affordable connectivity program will soon be available for eligible mathews residents  the program provides a discount of up to $30 per month toward broadband service for eligible households  she said  and breezeline and open broadband  two broadband providers in the county  are both participants in the program 

in addition  said rowe  breezeline is participating in the virginia telecommunications initiative’s line extension customer assistance program (lecap)  which assists eligible households with up to $3 000 of the cost of extending broadband lines down long driveways  funding for the program comes from the american rescue plan act of 2021 

“we’ve been going after affordability since we started ” said rowe during a telephone interview  “i cannot believe these opportunities … the possibilities are just extraordinary ”

according to a handout rowe shared  a federal qualifying household is one that meets at least one of the following criteria has an income at or below 200 percent of the federal poverty guidelines; participates in such assistance programs as snap  medicaid  federal public housing assistance  ssi  wic  or lifeline; meets the eligibility criteria for a participating broadband provider’s existing low-income program; or is approved to receive benefits under the free and reduced-priced school lunch or breakfast program  including through the usda community eligibility provision 

rowe explained that the last two criteria are particularly important to mathews  since mathews county has a poverty level that makes it eligible for free and reduced-price lunches and breakfasts for all of its students  she said that every mathews household with a child attending public school will qualify for the broadband service discount of $30 per month 

in addition  breezeline has recently created a low-income program for its customers  she said  and the price point for that service  coupled with the discount  will essentially make broadband free for any mathews county public school student who has breezeline for a provider  open broadband is considering such a program  as well  she said

The library was awarded $4,000 for program development and associated costs.

Increasingly, individuals find themselves challenged by technology when conducting routine tasks such as arranging appointments, applying for government services, seeking employment, and engaging in numerous other similar activities, said a press release.

The PLA Digital Literacy Workshop program, supported by AT&T, provides support to libraries to provide digital literacy training in their communities to help close the “digital divide,” said the release.

Beginning in October, the library plans to offer DigitaLearn workshops. Programs will be conducted at the library or at other selected sites, said the release. To date, the following workshops are scheduled: Computer Basics in October, Internet Basics in November, and Email Basics in February 2023. The exact dates and times will be announced later. Registration will be required.

Additional workshops during this time period and beyond may be scheduled, as well, said the release. Topics may include Cybersecurity, Videoconferencing, and Tablet Basics. “The mission of libraries has always been about equitable access to information, literacy, learning, and culture,” said PLA President Maria McCauley. Digital Literacy Workshops are intended to help community members build skills and confidence using technology.

88,Broadband towers addressed by Mathews board,Gloucester-Mathews Gazette-Journal,https://www.gazettejournal.net/broadband-towers-addressed-by-mathews-board/,Gloucester,10/2022,"The Mathews County Board of Supervisors met Monday night in the historic courthouse to take up several items remaining on the agenda after the Sept. 21 meeting was recessed because of the late hour.

Picking up where the board left off, board chairman Paul Hudgins had Judy Rowe, chair of the Mathews Broadband Advisory Board, complete her report, which had been interrupted as she addressed issues the board raised with two broadband towers slated to be built in the county.

During the Sept. 21 part of the meeting, the board decided to table a decision on approving conditional use permits for building the two communication towers, which, once completed, would provide broadband coverage over much of the county. After a public hearing earlier in September, the planning commission recommended approval of the CUPs with the added condition that the towers have safety lighting.

However, supervisors questioned whether the parcel designated for one of the towers on property belonging to Mathews Volunteer Fire Department at Station 2 in Bohannon had wetlands that would need mitigation. Supervisor Dave Jones suggested that, if that were the case, the county might need to look for a different property for that tower.

“We don’t want to approve it to get put up in the wrong fashion,” said Hudgins. “We want to make sure we’re doing it right.”

Planning and Zoning Director James Knighton explained to the board that, while there could be non-tidal wetlands at the site, the CUP could still be approved pending the U.S. Army Corps’ wetlands assessment. He said that the poles being installed were monopoles that required no guide wires, thus minimizing their footprints. He said that up to a tenth of an acre of land can be impacted without having to pay mitigation fees.

The second broadband tower is proposed for the property where the Mathews Volunteer Rescue Squad is located in Hudgins.

Another issue was raised when the board asked County Administrator Ramona Wilson how much land was included in the lease agreements on the towers. She told the board that no specific amount of land had been designated for the structures in the lease agreements, and Jones said the lease agreements may need to be amended.

“We need to know if we’re leasing 10,000 square feet or 5,000 square feet,” he said. “Whatever promises were made, we want to make sure it’s done right.”

Supervisor Mike Walls brought up the additional issue of the cost of leasing the land from the Mathews Volunteer Fire Department and the Mathews Volunteer Rescue Squad at $1,200 a month.

“Does the county not own a piece of land where we could put at least one,” he asked. “If we have something to speed it up with another piece of property, we need to do it.”

Wilson explained that changing the property would require redoing all the geo-technical data, which would cost additional money and delay the project further.

During Monday’s portion of the meeting, Rowe explained to supervisors how the two tower sites were chosen. She outlined a lengthy process that involved many trips to various sites, starting with sites on county property, in order to find something that was suitable. She said broadband board consultants and representatives had talked to tower companies, broadband providers, and engineers in their quest, and they discovered that county properties were not suitable for the towers for various reasons, from being too close to already existing towers to not having enough room for ingress and egress. They considered various private properties, as well, but none of them were suitable either, said Rowe.

However, she said, it turned out that the sites where the Mathews Volunteer Rescue Squad building and Bohannon Station 2 were located were ideal because they were situated in areas that would enable them to reach the parts of the county that were underserved.

The county’s consultant, Broadband Telecom, did radio frequency analyses on the two sites as well as heat maps to determine where repeaters would need to be located, said Rowe, and they confirmed that the sites were ideal. She said the county had grant funding from the American Rescue Plan Act to pay for the towers, and the only thing left to do was have the board approve the CUPs. She said a mistake had been made in each of the engineering drawings, but they had since been corrected. Stakes that delineated the locations had somehow been moved at both sites, she said, adding that the surveyors were embarrassed by the mistakes.

“We believe we’re in compliance,” said Rowe. “We hope to have the results by the next board meeting, and we will have certifications to turn over to the Army Corps that we’re not in wetlands.”

Walls also made reference to comments made by a local resident during public comment period regarding danger to the public from radio waves and microwaves being transmitted from telecommunications poles.

Rowe said the technology being used on the poles is already being used everywhere in the country, and there are “all kinds of towers and poles all around the county,” she said, adding, “We take our chances every day” when talking on cell phones.

Supervisor Melissa Mason wondered how the stakes were moved on both properties, saying, “I hope nobody’s going on properties and moving stakes.”

“We’ve come a long way, and I would hate to see that someone is trying to hamper or derail the progress being made,” she said, “especially with statewide grant funding.”

Mason said that radio frequencies “are so entrenched in our everyday lives that we can’t miss it,” and that research on the matter had gone into the grant request. In addition, she said that a complaint had been made at the last meeting about the danger of radio frequencies, but the same person who initiated the complaint “was willing to make land available for the towers.”

“This is something that everybody will benefit from,” she said, “and we need to keep our eyes going forward.”

During public comment period, George Machen of Foster stated that the complaint was not made by the same people who had offered land for the towers. He said he and his family made the complaint, but it was his brother who owned the property in question. He said the board should look for land it wouldn’t have to pay for to erect the tower, since “$1,200 a month—$300,000 for 10 years—is quite an investment.” He also called for proof the towers were safe before going forward.

Donnie Lewis, president of Mathews Volunteer Fire Department, rebutted Machen’s comments, saying the equipment will be located 200 feet up, and that there are no homes within 1,500 feet of the tower. Money from that tower will be used to buy fire trucks, hose, and other equipment, he told the board.

“If we don’t get it, we’ll just be asking you for it,” Lewis said. “Don’t base your decision on studies that don’t apply.”

“The fire department is one hundred percent on board with this cell tower,” he said.

Rowe stated additionally that the revenue generated by the towers “will be substantially more than $1,200 a month.”

In other matters, the board:

—Unanimously approved providing tax relief for the disabled after a public hearing on changing the regulation governing tax relief for the elderly to add relief for the disabled, as well;

—Unanimously approved a request by Building Official Kevin Zoll to demolish the maintenance shop located in the old Davidson home, a former gas station located adjacent to Port Fun, and replace it with a 50’ by 80’ maintenance shop located farther back on the 3½-acre property. The board also approved removing 41 trees on the property to accommodate the project and allocating $350,000 to pay for it;

—Directed County Attorney Andrea Erard to draft a curtailed version of the proposed noise ordinance and have another meeting with Sheriff Mark Barrick on the matter, then bring the issue before the board at its next meeting;

—Heard from Knighton that he had received the draft permit for the Hole in the Wall dredging project from the Army Corps of Engineers and is waiting on one document from the Virginia Department of Environmental Quality in order to be able to send out a request for proposals to complete the dredging, and

—Directed Wilson to talk to VDOT Saluda Residency Administrator Lee McKnight about doing a traffic study at the end of Old Ferry Road adjacent to the Cherry Point neighborhood to determine whether it would be feasible to reduce the speed limit to 25 mph, as requested by residents in the neighborhood.

rowe said the technology being used on the poles is already being used everywhere in the country  and there are “all kinds of towers and poles all around the county ” she said  adding  “we take our chances every day” when talking on cell phones 

supervisor melissa mason wondered how the stakes were moved on both properties  saying  “i hope nobody’s going on properties and moving stakes ”

“we’ve come a long way  and i would hate to see that someone is trying to hamper or derail the progress being made ” she said  “especially with statewide grant funding ”

mason said that radio frequencies “are so entrenched in our everyday lives that we can’t miss it ” and that research on the matter had gone into the grant request  in addition  she said that a complaint had been made at the last meeting about the danger of radio frequencies  but the same person who initiated the complaint “was willing to make land available for the towers ”

“this is something that everybody will benefit from ” she said  “and we need to keep our eyes going forward ”

during public comment period  george machen of foster stated that the complaint was not made by the same people who had offered land for the towers  he said he and his family made the complaint  but it was his brother who owned the property in question  he said the board should look for land it wouldn’t have to pay for to erect the tower  since “$1 200 a month—$300 000 for 10 years—is quite an investment ” he also called for proof the towers were safe before going forward 

donnie lewis  president of mathews volunteer fire department  rebutted machen’s comments  saying the equipment will be located 200 feet up  and that there are no homes within 1 500 feet of the tower  money from that tower will be used to buy fire trucks  hose  and other equipment  he told the board 

“if we don’t get it  we’ll just be asking you for it ” lewis said  “don’t base your decision on studies that don’t apply ”

“the fire department is one hundred percent on board with this cell tower ” he said 

rowe stated additionally that the revenue generated by the towers “will be substantially more than $1 200 a month ”

89,‘Still a long way to go’: Gloucester event celebrates Juneteenth,Gloucester-Mathews Gazette-Journal,https://www.gazettejournal.net/still-a-long-way-to-go-gloucester-event-celebrates-juneteenth/,Gloucester,06/2021,"Sweltering heat marked Saturday’s Juneteenth celebration in Gloucester, but it deterred neither the enthusiastic group of speakers who came to deliver a message nor the audience members who gathered at First Baptist Church to hear what those speakers had to say.


PHOTO COURTESY CIRCLEUP MIDDLE PENINSULA
Gloucester historian Dr. Wesley Wilson was the keynote speaker for the 2021 Juneteenth celebration, held on Saturday at First Baptist Church.
The Rev. E.R. Graham presided over the event, which was sponsored by the Gloucester Union Relief Association, the Woodville Rosenwald School Foundation, and CircleUp Middle Peninsula. Graham emphasized that it was the first time Juneteenth was being celebrated as a national holiday.

“It’s an indication that we should continue to press on, press on, press on,” he said.

With devotions by the Rev. Vincent Pryor, the day included inspirational music by the Gloucester/Mathews Male Chorus, refreshments by the youth of First Baptist, and a COVID-19 vaccination clinic operated by Three Rivers Health District. There were special presentations by Corrine F. Young, who read her “Juneteenth Poem”; D’Mori Garcia, who read his poem “Look at Me, Please” and C.J. McKeller, who played the saxophone.

Representatives of the sponsoring organizations took turns speaking, with the Rev. Bradley A. Holmes of the Gloucester Union Relief Association giving thanks for the role Graham played in keeping the 13 churches of the association connected during the pandemic.

Chuck Crook of CircleUp Middle Peninsula reflected on the past, suggesting that the Texas slaves who were the last to be freed after the Civil War wouldn’t have been welcomed to try on clothes at the general store or to sit down for a meal at the local restaurant. He recalled the days of segregation and said many of the same issues continue to this day.
“June 19, 1865 was a great day,” he said, “but there’s still a long way to go to build the type of community we all want and deserve.”

Bobby Ray of the Woodville Rosenwald School Foundation spoke about the diligent efforts of the Black community to raise the money to provide an education for their children, and about T.C. Walker approaching Sears Roebuck founder Julius Rosenwald, resulting in the construction of six schools in Gloucester for African American children.

Gloucester teacher Brian Teucke, pronouncing himself “a proud anti-racist,” spoke resoundingly of righting the wrongs of the past through a joint effort of African Americans and labor, and he urged everyone to “normalize celebrating Black lives,” “normalize celebrating Black educators” and “normalize celebrating Black children.”

“When we normalize celebrating Black children,” he said, “we offer affirmation that they hold in their hands the power to change the world.”

Keynote address

The keynote address was provided by local historian Dr. Wesley C. Wilson, who spoke about what it must have been like for the 250,000 enslaved people in Texas who were freed on June 19, 1865.

Wilson dismissed the idea that the slaves had previously been unaware of the Emancipation Proclamation and its implications for their own lives. He said Lincoln had first signaled his intent to sign the proclamation in 1862, when he introduced it to his cabinet, and it was publicized widely long before it actually went into effect in 1865.

The proclamation was offered as a “carrot-and-stick” proposition, he said, with Lincoln declaring only the slaves in the rebelling states free, hoping that those states would return to the Union if they thought it would mean keeping their slaves. It also offered the slaves in the rebelling states a place to “run and hide” with Union forces if they wanted to escape. It was unlikely that those messages didn’t reach Texas slaveholders, said Wilson, or that the enslaved people they would affect didn’t overhear their White enslavers talking about them.

The reason the Black people in Texas didn’t escape, theorized Wilson, was that they were far from Union encampments, so they had no place to run to if they did manage to get away. He pointed out that hordes of slaves went to “Freedom Fort” in Hampton during the war, but that there was a problem with the “unique and sheer power held by the White men of Texas.”

“In no state did slavers give up their slaves willingly,” said Wilson. “It took Union troops to separate the slaves from their enslavers.”

It’s more important now than ever to celebrate Juneteenth, said Wilson, because “it provides a reminder of the hardship and heartache they suffered.”

“Because they knew,” he said. “We can only imagine how much strength and perseverance it took to keep on when you knew you were free but had no place to run and hide. They not only kept the faith, but they stood tall.”

Wilson told the story of the Greek god Sisyphus, who was forced by Zeus to roll a boulder up a hill for eternity. Every time he would get near the top, the stone would roll back down. Wilson said that Sisyphus could have solved his problem by taking a piece of the mountain back down with him each time, eventually levelling the mountain and ending his ordeal.

“Let us see ourselves not as mountain climbers but as mountain levelers,” said Wilson. “We may not be able to right these voter suppression laws and other laws right now, but we can dream the impossible dream and make it come true.”

Other speakers who offered reflections were the Rev. Julia Forrest, who talked about the history of Antioch Baptist Church; Toni Oliva, who shared the history of Bethel Church; Brenda Dixon of the Gloucester NAACP, who spoke of ongoing efforts to end inequality in economics, education, health care and other areas; and Sheila Crowley, who reflected on people coming together last summer, both locally and across the nation, in the wake of the murder of George Floyd and the renewed push for social justice.

Bessida Cauthorne White of the Middle Peninsula African-American Genealogical and Historical Society talked about various celebrations that marked turning points in the efforts to free those who were enslaved, and Edith Turner of the Mathews Historical Museum called for people to work together to bring about freedom and justice for all.

90,Gloucester board gets remote learning update,Gloucester-Mathews Gazette-Journal,https://www.gazettejournal.net/gloucester-board-gets-remote-learning-update/,Gloucester,08/2020,"The Gloucester County School Board heard an update Tuesday on the school division’s “GCPS Learns Anywhere” remote learning framework that will be in place this fall.

This was the first in-person meeting the board has held since April. Six members attended the meeting in the T.C. Walker Education Center auditorium and a seventh attended virtually via Zoom.

The update included information on what assistance will be provided for families that need either electronic devices or better internet connectivity for remote learning.

The school board received over $600,000 in CARES Act funding, much of which will be dedicated to supporting online learning. At the board’s request, county supervisors contributed another $520,618 of its CARES Act funding to support the division’s technology needs (see related story).

The money will be used to supply Samsung Galaxy tablets for over 1,100 students in pre-kindergarten through second grades. It will also provide up to 650 Mi-Fi hot-spot devices to students and employees with limited internet access. The devices come with six months of unlimited, but content filtered, data.

The funds will also be used to equip about 15 school buses with high-gain mobile internet connections that will be placed in areas of the county with poor internet connectivity.

Outlines of the school day for elementary, middle and high school students were provided in earlier updates to parents, but division assistant superintendent Chuck Wagner said more detailed information will be provided for each child when teachers return to schools next Thursday. Students will also receive their login information for the CANVAS online learning framework.

Students will be expected to attend daily and participate in as much of their scheduled school day as possible. Attendance will be based on at least one daily meaningful interaction between the student and teacher, such as a phone call or text, email exchange or submission of a completed task or assignment.

For students with special needs, instructional staff will begin contacting families next week to revise Individual Education Plans to align services and supports with the education programs provided online. Staff will monitor student progress in order to recommend ad-justments as appropriate.

The latest update also provides preliminary information regarding the provision of student meal services, which will begin with the start of school on Sept. 8. Paid meals will be offered to all students.

An all-call message to families will provide information on the new online ordering system, a new mobile app, and survey information to determine which families will order meal services each week.

Meals will be prepared at all five county elementary schools and Gloucester High School, and meals will be delivered by school bus to designated bus stops. More meal information will be available on the GCPS Food Services website next week.

Other business

In other business, the board voted 6-1 to shift all projects in its long-range capital improvements plan from 2021 through 2025 to 2022 through 2026. The top two projects will continue to be the planned GHS renovations and the new bus compound and parking relocation. Board member Darren Post voted against the long-term CIP.

The board also voted to unanimously adopt a resolution in support of school resource officers and the Virginia School Resource Officer Grants Program and Fund. GCPS does not use the grant program to employ its six SROs but the board wanted to show its support for the option and SROs.

The board additionally nominated the Gloucester-Mathews Gazette-Journal and WXGM radio to the Virginia School Boards Association’s Media Honor Roll.

Winning students can earn prizes, scholarships, and recognition for their schools.

The CyberStart America program is a series of online challenges that allow students to act as cyber protection agents, to solve cybersecurity-related puzzles and explore topics such as code breaking, programming, networking and digital forensics.

All Virginia students in grades 9-12 are invited to participate. Experience or knowledge in information technology or cybersecurity is not necessary to compete.

High school students may register for the program and may begin playing the CyberStart Game at midnight on Nov. 15. They may continue playing, and invite their friends to join them through Feb. 28, 2021.

The National Cyber Scholarship Foundation anticipates awarding $2 million in scholarships to 600 high-scoring students across the nation who participate in the competition, a release said. Complete details may be found at https://bit.ly/CyberStartUSA.

Smart poles

One grant, totaling $197,144, will fund the installation of eight Clearworld smart poles in Wi-Fi dead spots around the county. Each solar-powered pole, at a cost of $24,643, will be equipped with a Cradlepoint access point to create a Wi-Fi network extending approximately 1,000 feet from the pole. The poles will also be lighted.

This will enable residents to drive to the parking lot where a pole is located and access the internet free of charge for educational and tele-health purposes. The poles will also provide internet access to homes within their coverage area.

Each smart pole will be able to connect at speeds up to 300 Mbps with 15 or more users at a time. Included in the grant was funding to provide unlimited data and customer support for each pole for one year and a remote monitoring system. Delivery and installation costs and one year of maintenance fees are covered, as well.

Poles will be located at Antioch Baptist Church at Susan, Bethel United Methodist Church on Garden Creek Road, West Mathews Community Center in Bohannon, Mathews Park and Ride lots on John Clayton Memorial Highway at North and Buckley Hall Road at Cobbs Creek, a private lot on Providence Road in Mobjack, the Piankatank Ruritan Club on Buckley Hall Road at Hudgins, and St. Matthew United Methodist Church on Potato Neck Road in Peary.

The terms of the grant require that the poles be installed and operational by mid- to late December.

Library hotspots

The other grant will fund the purchase of 25 Verizon Jetpack Mi-Fi hotspots and 25 Parsec antennas to provide unlimited 4G mobile broadband to library patrons who check the units out, similar to checking out a book, for up to 21 days at a time.

The units will enable students to do homework, employees to tele-work, and those with health issues to participate in tele-health sessions.

The total cost of all 25 units is $15,696.75.

Future use

When the pandemic has been brought under control and children can return to school and people can have unfettered access to health care providers, the smart poles will still be standing. Mathews County Broadband Advisory Board chairman Judy Rowe and broadband consultant Jeff Beekhoo of Norfolk-based Broadband Telecom have pointed out that the smart poles can then be used as repeaters to boost broadband signals throughout the county. If necessary, the poles can be relocated to serve additional purposes, as well, including being equipped with flood monitors in low-lying areas of the county.

Rowe expressed delight with the award during a telephone conversation on Monday.

“I’m just so thankful for the citizens who stepped up,” she said of the property owners who are allowing the smart poles to be installed on their property.

Rowe said it’s good to finally see progress on an issue she’s been advocating for over the past 20 years. She said that, in this age of advanced technology, too many people in rural areas, especially school children, are being left behind.

When she was asked to head the advisory board, Rowe asked the Mathews County Board of Supervisors to commit to bringing broadband to every last home in Mathews County. They agreed, and she has been tirelessly pursuing that goal ever since. She gives credit to members of the board who have expertise in various areas and who have come together on the board to lead the way.

“It’s an incredible group of people,” said Rowe. “It’s a brain trust.”

93,"Lectures examine effect of music, technology on dementia",Gloucester-Mathews Gazette-Journal,https://www.gazettejournal.net/lectures-examine-effect-of-music-technology-on-dementia/,Gloucester,12/2020,"The Alzheimer’s Association has two educational opportunities in the coming weeks for the Middle Peninsula community. Programs will be held virtually for the safety of participants, volunteers, and the community, but registration is required for both. These programs are funded by the Sanders Foundation Fund.

From 2-3 p.m. on Wednesday, Dec. 9, there will be a lecture on “Music & Dementia.” Music can enrich the lives of people with Alzheimer’s disease, allowing for self-expression and engagement, even after dementia has progressed. Studies have shown music may reduce agitation and improve behavioral issues that are common in the middle stages of the disease. Even in the late-stage Alzheimer’s, a person may be able to tap a beat or sing lyrics to a song from childhood. Music provides a way to connect, even after verbal communication has become difficult.

On Wednesday, Dec. 16, the lecture will focus on “Technology & Dementia.” The program, which will also be held from 2-3 p.m., will explore how technology can play a positive role in the care of a loved one suffering from Alzheimer’s or other forms of dementia.

For a person living with Alzheimer’s or another dementia and for the caregivers, technology is evolving and providing unique tools that are beneficial in aiding in care for loved ones, a release stated. Engaging with loved ones living with dementia and creating an environment that is safer are just a few areas where technology is improving.

94,GMHS adopts facial recognition technology to help find missing pets,Gloucester-Mathews Gazette-Journal,https://www.gazettejournal.net/gmhs-adopts-facial-recognition-technology-to-help-find-missing-pets/,Gloucester,04/2021,"This Friday on National Lost Dog and Cat Awareness Day, the Gloucester-Mathews Humane Society will join forces with Petco Love, a national nonprofit working to lead and inspire change for animals, and animal welfare groups across the country, on a shared mission to help reunite lost pets with their families should they ever go missing.

Petco Love Lost is a new, searchable national database that uses patented facial recognition technology to make finding lost pets quicker and easier. This simple-to-use tool will be easily accessible to participating animal organizations nationwide, as well as any pet parent or person who finds a lost pet. Uploaded photos of a missing dog or cat are immediately scanned to determine whether the lost pet is at a participating shelter or with a neighbor in the community.

“We see firsthand how quickly a pet can go missing, whether they were curious, following a scent, wandered through an open gate or became scared during a storm,” said GMHS CEO April Martinez. “We work tirelessly to care for pets, whether they’re awaiting their forever home or lost and need help getting back to their families. There’s nothing more rewarding than reuniting families with their beloved pets and with Petco Love Lost, we’re confident it can lead to many more happy reunions for pets and people of the communities we serve.”

“We know that one in three pets goes missing in their lifetime, an estimated 10 million pets each year, and we’re not okay with that,” said Susanne Kogut, president of Petco Love. “That gives us 10 million reasons why we created Petco Love Lost, because we believe nothing is more important than keeping people and pets together for a lifetime of love. Together with GMHS, our goal is to keep pets where they belong … at home, with you.”","['this', 'friday', 'on', 'national', 'lost', 'dog', 'and', 'cat', 'awareness', 'day', 'the', 'gloucester-mathews', 'humane', 'society', 'will', 'join', 'forces', 'with', 'petco', 'love', 'a', 'national', 'nonprofit', 'working', 'to', 'lead', 'and', 'inspire', 'change', 'for', 'animals', 'and', 'animal', 'welfare', 'groups', 'across', 'the', 'country', 'on', 'a', 'shared', 'mission', 'to', 'help', 'reunite', 'lost', 'pets', 'with', 'their', 'families', 'should', 'they', 'ever', 'go', 'missing', 'petco', 'love', 'lost', 'is', 'a', 'new', 'searchable', 'national', 'database', 'that', 'uses', 'patented', 'facial', 'recognition', 'technology', 'to', 'make', 'finding', 'lost', 'pets', 'quicker', 'and', 'easier', 'this', 'simple-to-use', 'tool', 'will', 'be', 'easily', 'accessible', 'to', 'participating', 'animal', 'organizations', 'nationwide', 'as', 'well', 'as', 'any', 'pet', 'parent', 'or', 'person', 'who', 'finds', 'a', 'lost', 'pet', 'uploaded', 'photos', 'of', 'a', 'missing', 'dog', 'or', 'cat', 'are', 'immediately', 'scanned', 'to', 'determine', 'whether', 'the', 'lost', 'pet', 'is', 'at', 'a', 'participating', 'shelter', 'or', 'with', 'a', 'neighbor', 'in', 'the', 'community', '“we', 'see', 'firsthand', 'how', 'quickly', 'a', 'pet', 'can', 'go', 'missing', 'whether', 'they', 'were', 'curious', 'following', 'a', 'scent', 'wandered', 'through', 'an', 'open', 'gate', 'or', 'became', 'scared', 'during', 'a', 'storm', '”', 'said', 'gmhs', 'ceo', 'april', 'martinez', '“we', 'work', 'tirelessly', 'to', 'care', 'for', 'pets', 'whether', 'they’re', 'awaiting', 'their', 'forever', 'home', 'or', 'lost', 'and', 'need', 'help', 'getting', 'back', 'to', 'their', 'families', 'there’s', 'nothing', 'more', 'rewarding', 'than', 'reuniting', 'families', 'with', 'their', 'beloved', 'pets', 'and', 'with', 'petco', 'love', 'lost', 'we’re', 'confident', 'it', 'can', 'lead', 'to', 'many', 'more', 'happy', 'reunions', 'for', 'pets', 'and', 'people', 'of', 'the', 'communities', 'we', 'serve', '”', '“we', 'know', 'that', 'one', 'in', 'three', 'pets', 'goes', 'missing', 'in', 'their', 'lifetime', 'an', 'estimated', '10', 'million', 'pets', 'each', 'year', 'and', 'we’re', 'not', 'okay', 'with', 'that', '”', 'said', 'susanne', 'kogut', 'president', 'of', 'petco', 'love', '“that', 'gives', 'us', '10', 'million', 'reasons', 'why', 'we', 'created', 'petco', 'love', 'lost', 'because', 'we', 'believe', 'nothing', 'is', 'more', 'important', 'than', 'keeping', 'people', 'and', 'pets', 'together', 'for', 'a', 'lifetime', 'of', 'love', 'together', 'with', 'gmhs', 'our', 'goal', 'is', 'to', 'keep', 'pets', 'where', 'they', 'belong', '…', 'at', 'home', 'with', 'you', '”']","['humane', 'will', 'love', 'welfare', 'help', 'love', 'recognition', 'will', 'accessible', 'well', 'shelter', 'open', 'help', 'rewarding', 'beloved', 'love', 'confident', 'happy', 'okay', 'love', 'love', 'important', 'love']","['lost', 'lost', 'lost', 'lost', 'lost', 'lost', 'scared', 'lost', 'need', 'lost', 'lost']",4.0,2021.0,"this friday on national lost dog and cat awareness day  the gloucester-mathews humane society will join forces with petco love  a national nonprofit working to lead and inspire change for animals  and animal welfare groups across the country  on a shared mission to help reunite lost pets with their families should they ever go missing

95,Mathews supervisors back broadband board requests,Gloucester-Mathews Gazette-Journal,https://www.gazettejournal.net/mathews-supervisors-back-broadband-board-requests/,Gloucester,08/2021,"The Mathews County Board of Supervisors threw its support behind the county’s Broadband Advisory Board during last Wednesday’s supervisors meeting, unanimously approving three requests that will enable the BAB to continue its strategic plan to bring 100 percent broadband coverage to Mathews County.

After a presentation by BAB chair Judy Rowe and consultant Jeff Beekhoo of Broadband Telecom Services, the board agreed to earmark $678,555 in American Rescue Plan funding to pay for building two broadband towers in the county—one at the Mathews Volunteer Rescue Squad building at Hudgins and the other at Mathews Volunteer Fire Department Station 2 in Bohannon.

The board also agreed to allow the broadband board to pursue funding from Gov. Ralph Northam’s newly-established $700 million broadband infrastructure fund to pay for a fiber backhaul from Hampton Roads to the Middle Peninsula. A backhaul would provide “high-capacity terabit bandwidth” to the county, said Beekhoo, greatly increasing the chances for economic growth.

Finally, the board agreed to allow the BAB to put Mathews on the list to pursue a Virginia Telecommunication Initiative grant to pay for the cost of fixed wireless equipment on the two towers that will be built.

Mathews Volunteer Fire Chief Donnie Lewis said that broadband coverage would make emergency services more efficient and help firefighters who are on the scene.

“This is what is needed right now,” Lewis said. “We have to have connectivity to make this work.”

Rowe said that Wi-Fi costs a lot more in Mathews than in other places because of the lack of a backhaul connection, and that building such a system will save the county money. The county is “positioned perfectly for this move,” she said, adding that it will “connect Mathews with the rest of the world.” Rowe said providers are telling other localities about the successes in Mathews and have suggested they call Rowe to find out what to do.

“Other counties are trying to do this with just a few people,” she said. “We’ve got an extraordinary team … We can’t say ‘the sky’s the limit’ anymore. We say ‘to infinity and beyond.’”

Dutton rezoning

The board voted 3-1-1 to approve the rezoning of a 28.37-acre parcel at the corner of Buckley Hall and Twigg Ferry roads from rural to business, with Paul Hudgins dissenting and Jackie Ingram recusing herself because of her job as a real estate agent.

The request was made by Rhetson Companies Inc. of West End, North Carolina, during a joint public hearing of the board of supervisors and the planning commission on July 18. The company explained that it proposes to develop 14 acres of the parcel as residential, seven acres as storage, and seven acres as commercial and retail. The planning commission subsequently voted 3-2, with two members absent, to recommend supervisors approve the rezoning.

Hudgins objected to the rezoning request, saying that traffic is a major concern at the intersection and development would create more congestion, that more housing would put more stress on emergency services, and that there could be issues with water supply when the property is developed.

Supervisor Amy Dubois pointed out that rezoning is just the first step in the process, and Planning and Zoning Director Thomas Jenkins confirmed that a conditional use permit would be required in order to develop the parcel. He said that a study of such things as density, traffic flow, and water usage would need to be made as part of the application.

Sheriff’s department requests

Mathews Sheriff Mark Barrick asked the board to approve a contract with Premier Broadband and Consulting LLC to provide internet technology (IT) services for his office at a cost of $79,000 for the coming year.

Barrick said the county “lost a valuable asset” when former IT Director Chuck Huntley accepted a position elsewhere. He explained further that IT for public safety is more detailed than for the rest of the county, and it needs someone who is properly trained.

“We had that when Mr. Huntley was here,” he said, “but IT needs can’t rest on one person … If we fall victim to a ransomware attack, it would be devastating. The new IT person is good, but he can’t address the needs of public safety. He’s going to need additional help.”

Dubois questioned whether hiring the firm would be in compliance with the county’s purchase policy, and County Administrator Mindy Conner said it would.

The board voted unanimously to contract with the firm.

At the sheriff’s request, the board also voted unanimously to approve the appropriation of a $150,000 call-handling equipment grant the sheriff’s office received to implement the next generation 911 system.

Cybersecurity

At the request of the Mathews County Electoral Board and Voter Registrar Carla Faulkner, the board unanimously approved $15,200 to hire an outside consultant to create a cybersecurity plan of action and milestones for the county’s computer network. The plan would bring the county into compliance with the Virginia Department of Elections’ statewide cybersecurity compliance assessment.

Electoral Board vice chair Jeff Bohn emphasized that the requirement has nothing to do with the voting machines and poll books because they are not connected to the internet and are not in jeopardy. It only involves security for the statewide voter registration system, he said, emphasizing that it’s “a huge job” that larger localities hire additional personnel to handle, but that smaller localities contract out to private companies. He said the result would be that “every department in the county would have better cybersecurity.”

County administrator’s retirement

During his presentation to the board, Sheriff Barrick recognized retiring County Administrator Mindy Conner, describing her as “a super supporter of the sheriff’s office and first responders.” He said she had helped the sheriff’s office become better equipped, and that the compensation plan she shepherded into being had benefitted his employees.

Barrick said that each year when he has traveled to attend training and conferences, “I’ve never heard anyone make a negative comment about Mrs. Conner. She is well respected around the entire state and regarded as a top administrator.”

“You and I always have not seen eye to eye,” he said to Conner, “but we’ve respected each other enough to find common ground. I’m proud to call you my county administrator and my friend.”

Barrick presented Conner with an award that he said is given for outstanding contributions to law enforcement.

Barrick’s presentation was met by applause, with many audience members and three board members, Dubois, Melissa Mason and Mike Rowe, giving Conner a standing ovation. Hudgins and Ingram remained seated and did not applaud.
During the meeting, a number of other people also expressed gratitude for Conner’s service and wished her well, including Mathews County Visitor Center Director Emily Allen, Community Services Board Director Linda Hodges, residents Dee Russell and Sharon Frye, Dubois, who said she appreciated Conner’s “professionalism, respect, and approach with the board,” and supervisor Mason, who praised Conner for having “presented yourself professionally, with grace and dignity.”

Additionally, Del. Keith Hodges (R-Middlesex) sponsored a resolution in the Virginia House of Delegates commending Conner as a “longtime public servant” who was “committed to excellence” and had a “remarkable career in public service.”

At the end of the meeting, chairman Mike Rowe presented Conner with a resolution expressing appreciation for her years of service and wishing her an enjoyable retirement. Both Hudgins and Ingram voted against the resolution.

Conner expressed appreciation for the “kind comments” and said it had been “an honor and a privilege to serve this community.”

“It’s a special place,” she said.

In other actions, the board:

—Unanimously agreed to hold a public hearing during its August meeting, at 6 p.m. on Monday, Aug. 23, to consider whether to appropriate $1.5 million in grant funding to pay for dredging the channel at Hole in the Wall and putting the spoils on Haven Beach. The hearing will also cover unfinished work on pre-planning for dredging at Winter Harbor in the amount of around $45,000. A public hearing is necessary because $1.5 million exceeds one percent of the Mathews County budget.

—Unanimously agreed to hold a public hearing during the August meeting at 6 p.m. on Monday, Aug. 23, to consider whether to apply for a VDOT grant to fund phase two of the Main Street Improvement Project, from Food Lion to Hyco Corner.

—Unanimously agreed to reissue an invitation for bids for ditch maintenance in the county.

—Unanimously approved $1,377 for security for Mathews Market Days, to be provided by the Mathews County Sheriff’s Office.

—Unanimously approved a request for a text amendment to the zoning ordinance to include concrete batch plant in the industrial zone.

—Unanimously approved the use of a school bus for shuttle services during the Buyboat Reunion to be held at Hudgins Horn Harbor Marina this weekend.

—Unanimously approved a lease purchase agreement for the public radio lease and financing project at a cost of $1,391,891, or just over $300,000 annually under the terms of financing.

county’s broadband advisory board during last wednesday’s supervisors meeting  unanimously approving three requests that will enable the bab to continue its strategic plan to bring 100 percent broadband coverage to mathews county 

after a presentation by bab chair judy rowe and consultant jeff beekhoo of broadband telecom services  the board agreed to earmark $678 555 in american rescue plan funding to pay for building two broadband towers in the county—one at the mathews volunteer rescue squad building at hudgins and the other at mathews volunteer fire department station 2 in bohannon 

the board also agreed to allow the broadband board to pursue funding from gov  ralph northam’s newly-established $700 million broadband infrastructure fund to pay for a fiber backhaul from hampton roads to the middle peninsula  a backhaul would provide “high-capacity terabit bandwidth” to the county  said beekhoo  greatly increasing the chances for economic growth 

finally  the board agreed to allow the bab to put mathews on the list to pursue a virginia telecommunication initiative grant to pay for the cost of fixed wireless equipment on the two towers that will be built 

mathews volunteer fire chief donnie lewis said that broadband coverage would make emergency services more efficient and help firefighters who are on the scene 

“this is what is needed right now ” lewis said  “we have to have connectivity to make this work ”

rowe said that wi-fi costs a lot more in mathews than in other places because of the lack of a backhaul connection  and that building such a system will save the county money  the county is “positioned perfectly for this move ” she said  adding that it will “connect mathews with the rest of the world ” rowe said providers are telling other localities about the successes in mathews and have suggested they call rowe to find out what to do 

“other counties are trying to do this with just a few people ” she said  “we’ve got an extraordinary team … we can’t say ‘the sky’s the limit’ anymore  we say ‘to infinity and beyond ’”

dutton rezoning

the board voted 3-1-1 to approve the rezoning of a 28 37-acre parcel at the corner of buckley hall and twigg ferry roads from rural to business  with paul hudgins dissenting and jackie ingram recusing herself because of her job as a real estate agent 

the request was made by rhetson companies inc  of west end  north carolina  during a joint public hearing of the board of supervisors and the planning commission on july 18  the company explained that it proposes to develop 14 acres of the parcel as residential  seven acres as storage  and seven acres as commercial and retail  the planning commission subsequently voted 3-2  with two members absent  to recommend supervisors approve the rezoning 

hudgins objected to the rezoning request  saying that traffic is a major concern at the intersection and development would create more congestion  that more housing would put more stress on emergency services  and that there could be issues with water supply when the property is developed 

supervisor amy dubois pointed out that rezoning is just the first step in the process  and planning and zoning director thomas jenkins confirmed that a conditional use permit would be required in order to develop the parcel  he said that a study of such things as density  traffic flow  and water usage would need to be made as part of the application 

sheriff’s department requests

mathews sheriff mark barrick asked the board to approve a contract with premier broadband and consulting llc to provide internet technology (it) services for his office at a cost of $79 000 for the coming year 

barrick said the county “lost a valuable asset” when former it director chuck huntley accepted a position elsewhere  he explained further that it for public safety is more detailed than for the rest of the county  and it needs someone who is properly trained 

“we had that when mr  huntley was here ” he said  “but it needs can’t rest on one person … if we fall victim to a ransomware attack  it would be devastating  the new it person is good  but he can’t address the needs of public safety  he’s going to need additional help ”

dubois questioned whether hiring the firm would be in compliance with the county’s purchase policy  and county administrator mindy conner said it would 

the board voted unanimously to contract with the firm 

at the sheriff’s request  the board also voted unanimously to approve the appropriation of a $150 000 call-handling equipment grant the sheriff’s office received to implement the next generation 911 system 

cybersecurity

at the request of the mathews county electoral board and voter registrar carla faulkner  the board unanimously approved $15 200 to hire an outside consultant to create a cybersecurity plan of action and milestones for the county’s computer network  the plan would bring the county into compliance with the virginia department of elections’ statewide cybersecurity compliance assessment 

electoral board vice chair jeff bohn emphasized that the requirement has nothing to do with the voting machines and poll books because they are not connected to the internet and are not in jeopardy  it only involves security for the statewide voter registration system  he said  emphasizing that it’s “a huge job” that larger localities hire additional personnel to handle  but that smaller localities contract out to private companies  he said the result would be that “every department in the county would have better cybersecurity ”

county administrator’s retirement

during his presentation to the board  sheriff barrick recognized retiring county administrator mindy conner  describing her as “a super supporter of the sheriff’s office and first responders ” he said she had helped the sheriff’s office become better equipped  and that the compensation plan she shepherded into being had benefitted his employees 

barrick said that each year when he has traveled to attend training and conferences  “i’ve never heard anyone make a negative comment about mrs  conner  she is well respected around the entire state and regarded as a top administrator ”

“you and i always have not seen eye to eye ” he said to conner  “but we’ve respected each other enough to find common ground  i’m proud to call you my county administrator and my friend ”

barrick presented conner with an award that he said is given for outstanding contributions to law enforcement 

barrick’s presentation was met by applause  with many audience members and three board members  dubois  melissa mason and mike rowe  giving conner a standing ovation  hudgins and ingram remained seated and did not applaud 
during the meeting  a number of other people also expressed gratitude for conner’s service and wished her well  including mathews county visitor center director emily allen  community services board director linda hodges  residents dee russell and sharon frye  dubois  who said she appreciated conner’s “professionalism  respect  and approach with the board ” and supervisor mason  who praised conner for having “presented yourself professionally  with grace and dignity ”

additionally  del  keith hodges (r-middlesex) sponsored a resolution in the virginia house of delegates commending conner as a “longtime public servant” who was “committed to excellence” and had a “remarkable career in public service ”

at the end of the meeting  chairman mike rowe presented conner with a resolution expressing appreciation for her years of service and wishing her an enjoyable retirement  both hudgins and ingram voted against the resolution 

conner expressed appreciation for the “kind comments” and said it had been “an honor and a privilege to serve this community ”

“it’s a special place ” she said

The school’s STEM programs are being restructured, with the science and math departments in the process of integrating Career and Technical Education foundations into the curricula.

The STEM-Hawks (a play on the school’s Seahawks mascot) attempt to apply what’s taught in the classroom into real-world situations. And STEM-Hawks is also the name of the teams that compete under the banner of Thomas Hunter in science, technology and math contests.

The school will be offering new entrepreneurship and robotics classes this year. Karen Lloyd will be teaching the entrepreneurship class, where students work on product design and then turn that product into a business. And Christine Wheeler and Jason Williams are heading up the school’s robotics program.

While students are taught the mandated state Standards of Learning courses in math and science, STEM-Hawks looks to demonstrate the real-world application of those disciplines. “We also want them to have the skill application … so they apply them meaningfully,” Noonan said. For example, it’s one thing to master algebra skills, but quite another to take that knowledge and apply it to drawing up plans in order to build something.

“We’re trying to gather interest in the different career clusters,” he said.

The courses look to expose the students to what’s available in the “real world” beyond school. STEM-Hawks seeks to “start the platform here,” Noonan said, something that will be built upon at Mathews High School, where students have more opportunities to learn about trades and take part in internships.

About a third of the electives offered at the middle school are CTE courses. “There’s a definite interest” in CTE programs, Noonan said. “Pretty much all the CTE classes have healthy numbers.”

Noonan said that the school will integrate some of the competitions into the classroom, as well as offering them as after-school enrichment. Competitions include contests offered by FIRST Lego League Robotics, the Technology Student Association, the MATHCOUNTS Foundation, Destination Imagination, 4H and the SWENext (Society of Women Engineers), among others.

“We will be reaching out to obtain partners” in the region’s business community, both to help with financial sponsorship and also to provide expertise to help plan and develop instructional programs.

“We would love to have some business partners who would sit down with the teachers” to bounce ideas off one another, Noonan said.

Beach has more than 25 years’ experience in the IT field in both the public and private sectors. He most recently served as IT project manager for the City of Newport News, overseeing all areas of Enterprise Resource Planning, Cybersecurity, Geographic Information Systems (GIS), and Public Safety Telecommunications.

In that role, he also oversaw all project managers and their staff members. Prior to working for Newport News, he worked in the private sector serving in similar roles.

“We are thrilled that Mr. Beach has accepted the Director of Information Technology position,” Steele said. “Eric’s IT project management expertise in the private and municipal arenas will serve our county well. His extensive leadership in public safety and cybersecurity, will bring a fresh approach to Gloucester’s longstanding commitment to keep our residents well-informed and connected—all the while improving processes, supporting staff, and serving the community overall.”

Beach will report to George Bains, who is the county’s Chief Information of Technology Officer and Deputy County Administrator. According to Bains, two of Beach’s major projects will be assisting with the county’s broadband project and managing the purchase and installation of new ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning) software.

“Gloucester County has been very welcoming, and I am excited to be here,” Beach said. “I am passionate about connecting the dots, while identifying and developing the potential of people and processes, and ultimately bringing different groups together to identify solutions for the common good. I look forward to using these skills in leading an already cohesive and productive team in Gloucester.”

A graduate of Christopher Newport University with a degree in Business Administration and Economics, Beach has completed Project Management Continued Education at Virginia Tech, is a member of the Project Management Institute, and holds a certificate of Newport News Leadership.

Beach is a self-described “car guy,” appreciates outdoor recreation such as biking and camping, is a CrossFit enthusiast, and enjoys spending time with his son Keller and daughter Morgan.

98,Excellent Educators: Using technology to enhance learning,WAVY-TV 10,https://www.wavy.com/excellent-educators/excellent-educators-using-technology-to-enhance-learning/,Portsmouth,05/2022,"MATHEWS COUNTY, Va. (WAVY) — At Mathews Elementary, one 3rd grade teacher has incorporated her love of technology into her everyday teaching. In fact, she’s the only teacher in her school still teaching a virtual class.

“It’s kind of a form of art,” explained Christina Tomcany .

Tomcany spent the summer of 2019 taking online courses to grow her class website and create a system easy for parents to navigate. Little did she know those new skills would become a necessity during the COVID-19 pandemic.

“I really believe in keeping everybody in the loop. So when I taught myself how to make a website, I came back to school and I taught everybody at school how to make a website,” Tomcany stated.

It’s a streamlined system that Tomcany’s third grade class and their parents could easily access.

“I love a good Bitmoji so I’ve got that on there and we have two portals here. It’s just trial and error and then it’s repeat, repeat, repeat once you get it done and you can just repeat the steps you did before. I’m super lucky because my husband is also a teacher so I always had somebody at home that I could bounce ideas off of,” Tomcany told 10 On Your Side.

In addition to her 16 students, this Excellent Educator also has two virtual students and spends most of her day at her desk seamlessly incorporating her students learning from home into her in-person lessons.

“I’ve seen all my students in my class show enormous growth this year,” Tomcany explained.

When she’s not updating her class website, teaching in front of the camera or the classroom, you can find Tomcany on Friday nights working at Richardson’s Cafe and immersing herself in the Mathews County community.

“All of the kids in here know it and they all tell me if they’re coming that night and the big thing there is they always have ice cream,” Tomcany said.

Tomcany also coaches the Mathews High School Crew team.","['mathews', 'county', 'va', '(wavy)', '—', 'at', 'mathews', 'elementary', 'one', '3rd', 'grade', 'teacher', 'has', 'incorporated', 'her', 'love', 'of', 'technology', 'into', 'her', 'everyday', 'teaching', 'in', 'fact', 'she’s', 'the', 'only', 'teacher', 'in', 'her', 'school', 'still', 'teaching', 'a', 'virtual', 'class', '“it’s', 'kind', 'of', 'a', 'form', 'of', 'art', '”', 'explained', 'christina', 'tomcany', 'tomcany', 'spent', 'the', 'summer', 'of', '2019', 'taking', 'online', 'courses', 'to', 'grow', 'her', 'class', 'website', 'and', 'create', 'a', 'system', 'easy', 'for', 'parents', 'to', 'navigate', 'little', 'did', 'she', 'know', 'those', 'new', 'skills', 'would', 'become', 'a', 'necessity', 'during', 'the', 'covid-19', 'pandemic', '“i', 'really', 'believe', 'in', 'keeping', 'everybody', 'in', 'the', 'loop', 'so', 'when', 'i', 'taught', 'myself', 'how', 'to', 'make', 'a', 'website', 'i', 'came', 'back', 'to', 'school', 'and', 'i', 'taught', 'everybody', 'at', 'school', 'how', 'to', 'make', 'a', 'website', '”', 'tomcany', 'stated', 'it’s', 'a', 'streamlined', 'system', 'that', 'tomcany’s', 'third', 'grade', 'class', 'and', 'their', 'parents', 'could', 'easily', 'access', '“i', 'love', 'a', 'good', 'bitmoji', 'so', 'i’ve', 'got', 'that', 'on', 'there', 'and', 'we', 'have', 'two', 'portals', 'here', 'it’s', 'just', 'trial', 'and', 'error', 'and', 'then', 'it’s', 'repeat', 'repeat', 'repeat', 'once', 'you', 'get', 'it', 'done', 'and', 'you', 'can', 'just', 'repeat', 'the', 'steps', 'you', 'did', 'before', 'i’m', 'super', 'lucky', 'because', 'my', 'husband', 'is', 'also', 'a', 'teacher', 'so', 'i', 'always', 'had', 'somebody', 'at', 'home', 'that', 'i', 'could', 'bounce', 'ideas', 'off', 'of', '”', 'tomcany', 'told', '10', 'on', 'your', 'side', 'in', 'addition', 'to', 'her', '16', 'students', 'this', 'excellent', 'educator', 'also', 'has', 'two', 'virtual', 'students', 'and', 'spends', 'most', 'of', 'her', 'day', 'at', 'her', 'desk', 'seamlessly', 'incorporating', 'her', 'students', 'learning', 'from', 'home', 'into', 'her', 'in-person', 'lessons', '“i’ve', 'seen', 'all', 'my', 'students', 'in', 'my', 'class', 'show', 'enormous', 'growth', 'this', 'year', '”', 'tomcany', 'explained', 'when', 'she’s', 'not', 'updating', 'her', 'class', 'website', 'teaching', 'in', 'front', 'of', 'the', 'camera', 'or', 'the', 'classroom', 'you', 'can', 'find', 'tomcany', 'on', 'friday', 'nights', 'working', 'at', 'richardson’s', 'cafe', 'and', 'immersing', 'herself', 'in', 'the', 'mathews', 'county', 'community', '“all', 'of', 'the', 'kids', 'in', 'here', 'know', 'it', 'and', 'they', 'all', 'tell', 'me', 'if', 'they’re', 'coming', 'that', 'night', 'and', 'the', 'big', 'thing', 'there', 'is', 'they', 'always', 'have', 'ice', 'cream', '”', 'tomcany', 'said', 'tomcany', 'also', 'coaches', 'the', 'mathews', 'high', 'school', 'crew', 'team']","['love', 'kind', 'easy', 'streamlined', 'love', 'good', 'just', 'just', 'super', 'lucky', 'excellent', 'learning']","['little', 'trial', 'error', 'enormous']",5.0,2022.0,"mathews county  va  (wavy) — at mathews elementary  one 3rd grade teacher has incorporated her love of technology into her everyday teaching  in fact  she’s the only teacher in her school still teaching a virtual class

99,"Decision to allow Rosie’s entertainment complex at former Greenbrier Sears delayed over traffic, parking concerns",WAVY-TV 10,https://www.wavy.com/news/local-news/chesapeake/decision-to-allow-rosies-entertainment-complex-at-former-greenbrier-sears-delayed-over-traffic-parking-concerns/,Portsmouth,02/2020,"However, the Chesapeake Planning Department staff report recommended the plan be denied because it would cause continued traffic troubles for an already busy corridor.

A traffic study found upwards of 11,600 vehicles per day could head to the site. Two intersections that currently operate at “E” grade levels (Greenbrier Parkway/Crossways Boulevard and Greenbrier Parkway/Eden Way) would operate at “F” levels — a worse grade for an intersection — under the new development, the report finds.

In addition, planning staff expressed concern that developers asked to provide more than 1,000 fewer parking spaces than required by city zoning law.

In an effort to solve city concerns, Seritage committed to building a parking deck if parking becomes a concern, while also re-striping the southbound approach to the intersection of River Birch Run and Eden Way.

It wasn’t enough for the Planning Commission.

“We keep adding more and more and more,” said commissioner Shelley Deneau, referring to the traffic.

She also took issue with the fact that nearby apartments were not notified with Rosie’s hours of 8 a.m. till 2 a.m.

“I don’t believe it is the right fit,” said Commissioner Harold Gilbert. “I will not vote on it tonight or whether we do it 60 days from now.

Still others like commissioner Marty Williams, who admitted he is a Rosie’s fan, requested the developer refine the proposal when they return.

Developers, however, strongly suggested there were no other options.

“For the last four years our leasing team has been trying to market this property with no success. There is no plan B!” Robert Ursini, a development consultant with Seritage, told commissioners.

Grady Palmer, the attorney representing Seritage, mentioned that the vendors of Greenbrier Mall really are excited about the idea of filling a vacant anchor store.

Sears closed its Greenbrier Mall location in 2018 after nearly 40 years in the spot. It opened with the mall in the early 1980s.

With brick and mortar retail struggling, Seritage bought the property in 2015 with a mission to “create and own revitalized shopping, dining, entertainment and mixed-use destinations that provide enriched experiences for consumers and local communities and create long-term value for our shareholders.”

“I really believe that a vote … for this project is a vote to save Greenbrier Mall,” Ursini said.

100,Ocean View Art Show returns to Norfolk after 2-year hiatus,WAVY-TV 10,https://www.wavy.com/living-local/ocean-view-art-show-returns-to-norfolk-after-2-year-hiatus/,Portsmouth,09/2022,"NORFOLK, Va. (WAVY) — The 58th Annual Ocean View Art Show returns to Norfolk after a two-year hiatus. The two-day art festival is Oct. 8-9 from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m., at Ocean View Beach Park. 

The festival is hosted by the Chesapeake Bay Arts Association and will feature over 50 artists, live music, and food vendors. 

Proceeds from the event benefit the John B. Tenney Memorial Scholarship Fund which is awarded to local high school seniors who plan to pursue their education in the arts. 

“Art students really need the scholarships; now, more than ever,” said CBAA President Vivian Davis. “With the help of our great community, we hope to surpass our previous goals and have an even greater connection and impact.” 

Working Class Karma, a local nonprofit, is contributing to the live performances.  

“We’re trying to do more than organize and fund the music,” said Lori Dunn, president of Working Class Karma. “The goal is to have the entertainers themselves promoting and sharing the donate button.”

(WAVY) – The new Grafton Kroger introduced ‘Scan, Bag, Go’ this week to Hampton Roads. The new technology lets customers scan their products into their cart as they shop using a handheld scanner or their cellphone. 

The York County location opened to the public in late October just off George Washington Memorial Highway.  

 “Our customers want the ability to choose when and how they shop with us to make their lives easier,” said Allison McGee, corporate affairs manager of the Mid-Atlantic Division.  “Our goal is to provide customers a simple, personalized shopping experience that saves them time and money.”

Customers are encouraged to bring their own bags to reduce waste and make shopping easier for them as well. The hope is to make this possible in more Kroger locations as time goes on.

112,"Portsmouth signs casino development agreement, approves proposal Tuesday",WAVY-TV 10,https://www.wavy.com/news/local-news/portsmouth/portsmouth-signs-casino-development-agreement-approves-proposal-tuesday/,Portsmouth,05/2020,"PORTSMOUTH, Va. (WAVY) — The possibility of a casino coming to the City of Portsmouth is one step closer to coming to fruition — but there are still several steps left in the process.

On Tuesday, Portsmouth City Council approved a casino development proposal with Chicago-based Rush Street Gaming during a public meeting, Rush Street Gaming announced in a news release.

The move comes just one week after the Portsmouth Economic Development Authority approved a development agreement with Rush Street Gaming.

Rush Street Gaming is a casino developer and operator that has four casinos in Pennsylvania, Illinois and New York state under the “Rivers Casino” branding.

In November, City Council unanimously approved a “memorandum of understanding” with Rush Street Gaming, moving forward with negotiations for the project.

The actual development of a casino is dependent on approval through a citywide referendum. The agreement and proposal are part of a package that will be sent to the Lottery Board in Richmond.

The Lottery Board will need to approve and certify the package to allow a city referendum to be held. The referendum would be put on Portsmouth ballots in November for residents to vote on.

If approved, the casino proposal includes a phased approach that will begin with a casino and entertainment venue along Interstate 264. The development will include a variety of restaurants, a sportsbook and other entertainment opportunities.

“This development agreement is an important step in the approval process and is very exciting for Portsmouth,” said Portsmouth Mayor John L. Rowe. “Rush Street Gaming, led by Neil Bluhm and his team, has a great national reputation, and they have an impeccable track record of more than 20 years in the gaming industry. They understand Portsmouth’s vision for the Entertainment District beyond the mere presence of the casino.”

The city says a casino will boost tourism and increase the number of temporary and permanent jobs in the area.

Rush Street will be required to invest a minimum of $300 million by state legislation. It will also bring about 1,400 construction jobs to the area and 2,000-plus permanent new jobs.

Those permanent jobs are estimated to bring at least $62 million in annual wages, tips and salaries.

“Rush Street Gaming welcomes the opportunity to work with the Virginia Lottery Board,” said Jacob Oberman, senior vice president of development for Rush Street. “Certainly, there is plenty of work ahead to demonstrate our suitability before the Board, the residents of the city and the Commonwealth at large.

on tuesday  portsmouth city council approved a casino development proposal with chicago-based rush street gaming during a public meeting  rush street gaming announced in a news release 

the move comes just one week after the portsmouth economic development authority approved a development agreement with rush street gaming 

rush street gaming is a casino developer and operator that has four casinos in pennsylvania  illinois and new york state under the “rivers casino” branding 

in november  city council unanimously approved a “memorandum of understanding” with rush street gaming  moving forward with negotiations for the project 

the actual development of a casino is dependent on approval through a citywide referendum  the agreement and proposal are part of a package that will be sent to the lottery board in richmond 

the lottery board will need to approve and certify the package to allow a city referendum to be held  the referendum would be put on portsmouth ballots in november for residents to vote on

if approved  the casino proposal includes a phased approach that will begin with a casino and entertainment venue along interstate 264  the development will include a variety of restaurants  a sportsbook and other entertainment opportunities

“this development agreement is an important step in the approval process and is very exciting for portsmouth ” said portsmouth mayor john l  rowe  “rush street gaming  led by neil bluhm and his team  has a great national reputation  and they have an impeccable track record of more than 20 years in the gaming industry  they understand portsmouth’s vision for the entertainment district beyond the mere presence of the casino ”

the city says a casino will boost tourism and increase the number of temporary and permanent jobs in the area 

rush street will be required to invest a minimum of $300 million by state legislation  it will also bring about 1 400 construction jobs to the area and 2 000-plus permanent new jobs 

those permanent jobs are estimated to bring at least $62 million in annual wages  tips and salaries 

“rush street gaming welcomes the opportunity to work with the virginia lottery board ” said jacob oberman  senior vice president of development for rush street  “certainly  there is plenty of work ahead to demonstrate our suitability before the board  the residents of the city and the commonwealth at large  we couldn’t be more eager to get started ”

114,Council Scouting Virginia Artists to Design Midtown Row Murals,WYDaily,https://wydaily.com/our-community/2022/04/21/council-scouting-virginia-artists-to-design-midtown-row-murals/,Williamsburg,04/2022,"WILLIAMSBURG — The Williamsburg Public Art Council (WPAC) announced that it is searching for Virginia-based artists or artist teams to design two murals in Midtown Row.

WPAC posted a Request for Quotes (RFQ) online at the beginning of the month on April 1, 2022.

Midtown Row and WPAC worked together to explore potential sites for the murals, and at the end of that process, two walls located at the Food Lion building were selected as the mural sites.

According to the RFQ, “Through its Public Art Program, the Williamsburg Public Art Council wishes to celebrate the City’s past, present, and future with public art; enhance the City’s identity and economic vitality by encouraging people to spend more time in the City engaged with public art; and highlight and enhance the beauty and unique character of the City.”

The solicitation for bids is open to all Virginia-based artists and teams of artists. However, preference is given to artists with a special connection to the Greater Williamsburg area.

According to a release, “Based on a public input survey conducted in the fall of 2021, the themes of ‘Community Connections’ and ‘Nature & Beauty’ were chosen for walls. The proposed budgets should not exceed the amounts of $11,000 and $7,000 for each respective wall.”

“The Public Art Council is thrilled to kick off the first mural project in Williamsburg,” said WPAC Chair Robert Currie in a release. “There are some very exciting artists and art collectives working in Virginia, so we look forward to seeing the mural proposals that are submitted for these walls in Midtown Row.”

The deadline for submissions is set for 4:30 p.m. on May 16. Afterward, the WPAC and City staff will work to select finalists and a public comment period will open in July. The selected winner will be announced in early August and installation is slated to be completed by Sept. 15.

Artists who are interested in submitting a bid can find the RFQ online at the City of Williamsburg government website for additional information.","['williamsburg', '—', 'the', 'williamsburg', 'public', 'art', 'council', '(wpac)', 'announced', 'that', 'it', 'is', 'searching', 'for', 'virginia-based', 'artists', 'or', 'artist', 'teams', 'to', 'design', 'two', 'murals', 'in', 'midtown', 'row', 'wpac', 'posted', 'a', 'request', 'for', 'quotes', '(rfq)', 'online', 'at', 'the', 'beginning', 'of', 'the', 'month', 'on', 'april', '1', '2022', 'midtown', 'row', 'and', 'wpac', 'worked', 'together', 'to', 'explore', 'potential', 'sites', 'for', 'the', 'murals', 'and', 'at', 'the', 'end', 'of', 'that', 'process', 'two', 'walls', 'located', 'at', 'the', 'food', 'lion', 'building', 'were', 'selected', 'as', 'the', 'mural', 'sites', 'according', 'to', 'the', 'rfq', '“through', 'its', 'public', 'art', 'program', 'the', 'williamsburg', 'public', 'art', 'council', 'wishes', 'to', 'celebrate', 'the', 'city’s', 'past', 'present', 'and', 'future', 'with', 'public', 'art;', 'enhance', 'the', 'city’s', 'identity', 'and', 'economic', 'vitality', 'by', 'encouraging', 'people', 'to', 'spend', 'more', 'time', 'in', 'the', 'city', 'engaged', 'with', 'public', 'art;', 'and', 'highlight', 'and', 'enhance', 'the', 'beauty', 'and', 'unique', 'character', 'of', 'the', 'city', '”', 'the', 'solicitation', 'for', 'bids', 'is', 'open', 'to', 'all', 'virginia-based', 'artists', 'and', 'teams', 'of', 'artists', 'however', 'preference', 'is', 'given', 'to', 'artists', 'with', 'a', 'special', 'connection', 'to', 'the', 'greater', 'williamsburg', 'area', 'according', 'to', 'a', 'release', '“based', 'on', 'a', 'public', 'input', 'survey', 'conducted', 'in', 'the', 'fall', 'of', '2021', 'the', 'themes', 'of', '‘community', 'connections’', 'and', '‘nature', '&', 'beauty’', 'were', 'chosen', 'for', 'walls', 'the', 'proposed', 'budgets', 'should', 'not', 'exceed', 'the', 'amounts', 'of', '$11', '000', 'and', '$7', '000', 'for', 'each', 'respective', 'wall', '”', '“the', 'public', 'art', 'council', 'is', 'thrilled', 'to', 'kick', 'off', 'the', 'first', 'mural', 'project', 'in', 'williamsburg', '”', 'said', 'wpac', 'chair', 'robert', 'currie', 'in', 'a', 'release', '“there', 'are', 'some', 'very', 'exciting', 'artists', 'and', 'art', 'collectives', 'working', 'in', 'virginia', 'so', 'we', 'look', 'forward', 'to', 'seeing', 'the', 'mural', 'proposals', 'that', 'are', 'submitted', 'for', 'these', 'walls', 'in', 'midtown', 'row', '”', 'the', 'deadline', 'for', 'submissions', 'is', 'set', 'for', '4', '30', 'p', 'm', 'on', 'may', '16', 'afterward', 'the', 'wpac', 'and', 'city', 'staff', 'will', 'work', 'to', 'select', 'finalists', 'and', 'a', 'public', 'comment', 'period', 'will', 'open', 'in', 'july', 'the', 'selected', 'winner', 'will', 'be', 'announced', 'in', 'early', 'august', 'and', 'installation', 'is', 'slated', 'to', 'be', 'completed', 'by', 'sept', '15', 'artists', 'who', 'are', 'interested', 'in', 'submitting', 'a', 'bid', 'can', 'find', 'the', 'rfq', 'online', 'at', 'the', 'city', 'of', 'williamsburg', 'government', 'website', 'for', 'additional', 'information']","['potential', 'wishes', 'vitality', 'encouraging', 'highlight', 'beauty', 'unique', 'open', 'preference', 'special', 'exciting', 'will', 'will', 'open', 'will', 'interested']",['kick'],4.0,2022.0,"williamsburg — the williamsburg public art council (wpac) announced that it is searching for virginia-based artists or artist teams to design two murals in midtown row

115,Art on the Square Returning to Williamsburg After Two Years,WYDaily,https://wydaily.com/our-community/2022/04/14/art-on-the-square-returning-to-williamsburg-after-two-years/,Williamsburg,04/2022,"WILLIAMSBURG — For the first time in two years, Colonial Williamsburg will see the return of a local art show featuring a variety of artists and vendors.

The 57th Annual Art on the Square art show will be held on Sunday, April 24 in Colonial Williamsburg along N. Boundary and Scotland streets.

Art on the Square will feature over 80 artists and numerous local vendors. The community will have the opportunity to shop and support the artists.

The event is hosted by the Junior Woman’s Club of Williamsburg (JWCW), a volunteer organization for civic-minded women in their twenties, thirties, and forties.

The club supports various charitable organizations and community services through financial and volunteer assistance with a focus on a variety of areas including arts, education, and health.

Art on the Square is the club’s largest fundraising event hosted each year.

“We’re so excited to be back for another year of Art on the Square,” Meghan Robbins, president of JWCW, said. “We’re thrilled to see interest from new and returning artists and this year holds a special place in our hearts as we honor the late Richard DePaul, our featured artist for more than 20 years.”

DePaul painted “The Tulip Path,” his last painting for Art on the Square before his passing in 2020.

Proceeds from artist booth fees and raffle ticket sales are donated to visual and performing arts organizations in the Greater Williamsburg area, including the Richard DePaul Memorial Scholarship.

The event will see a number of returning artists this year, including Susan Bock, a Richmond-based artist whose oil painting techniques bring historic and black and white images to life.

“I’m a black and white photographer, and I used to hand-tint my own work,” Bock said. “At least 15 years ago, I started restoring and hand-tinting historic images, which is what I display. They were so popular, I kind of got lost in it. And, of course, it suits Williamsburg really well.”

Bock, who has participated in Art on the Square for approximately 10 years, said that she enjoys connecting with visitors over her work.

“It’s awesome to be in the studio working on my pieces, but the fun part is being there displaying it and talking to people,” she said. “I think the images always bring up conversations because it’s nostalgic for people. It brings back really fond memories for people.”

Among Bock’s most popular works that will be on display is a section that highlights ordinary women doing extraordinary things.

“I didn’t put famous women in it. I put ordinary women who are playing baseball, or were suffragettes,” she said.

This will be New York artist Lillian Forziat’s second year at Art on the Square. Lillian and her husband and business partner, Cliff, first attended in 2019; the last Art on the Square before it was canceled due to the pandemic.

Her work includes oil painting landscapes, still life, and seascapes. Her most popular works are her seashell, fruits, and vegetable portraits.

“Williamsburg is a very traditional, historic area, and my work is very traditional. I think it goes well there,” she said.

Visitors will be able to view and purchase Lillian’s work, including her original framed oil paintings.

Lillian and Cliff look forward to reconnecting with former customers and meeting new people.

“I love when people come into my tent and I watch where their eyes gravitate to because I have so many different subjects,” Lillian said. “I like to see what they’re most interested in. I used to do galleries, and they’re kind of a middle man. I like being at the shows because the middle man is gone and I can connect with the customers.”

The couple said that an event like Art on the Square is vital to the community.

“Art should touch you personally and it should make a connection with people, and the fact that [the Junior Woman’s Club] is also making a connection with the community is very special,” Cliff said.

“They’re making art available to the average person,” Lillian added.

Art on the Square is free and open to the public. Visitors can also purchase raffle tickets at the JWCW tent to win an original DePaul painting.

116,Hampton Roads’ largest employer to use 3D printing technology,WYDaily,https://wydaily.com/business/2018/10/16/hampton-roads-largest-employer-to-use-3d-printing-technology/,Williamsburg,08/2018,"The Newport News Shipbuilding division of Huntington Ingalls Industries will use a metal prototype created by 3D-printing on the USS Harry S. Truman next year.

According to the Navy’s news release, the metal part is a drain strainer orifice used to remove water from a steam line “while in use” and will be tested and evaluated on the nuclear aircraft carrier for one year.

It will be the first 3D printed metal part used for shipbuilding and was approved by the Naval Sea Systems Command, according to the Navy’s news release.

Otherwise known as additive manufacturing, 3D printing is a technological process that uses a computer operated printer to create three-dimensional objects, layer by layer, out of plastic or metal material, according to the 3D printing website.

In May, the 3D printing business, 3D Systems, announced its collaboration with the shipbuilding company and the Navy to install one of its metal 3D printers, ProX DMP 320, at the Newport News Shipbuilding division’s facilities, according to the 3D Systems news release.

The ProC DMP 320 will create parts such as valves, housings and brackets, including the DSO for the USS Harry S. Truman aircraft carrier that will potentially replace castings and other parts, according to Newport News Shipbuilding.

“This is a watershed moment in our digital transformation, as well as a significant step forward in naval and marine engineering,” said Charles Southall, vice president of engineering and design at Newport News Shipbuilding. “We are committed to partnering with the Navy to ensure that collectively, we are investing in every opportunity to improve and advance the way we design and build great ships for the Navy.”

117,‘Black is Beautiful’: An initiative that’s bringing in funds to a new local nonprofit teaching kids media production,WYDaily,https://wydaily.com/news/local/2020/07/07/black-is-beautiful-an-initiative-thats-bringing-in-funds-to-a-new-local-nonprofit-teaching-kids-media-production/,Williamsburg,07/2020,"A new local collaboration is bringing together philanthropy and media production.

Oh, and beer.

The Virginia Beer Company has partnered with a nationwide movement to sell the new “Black is Beautiful” brew which will benefit the new local nonprofit, Media Mentors. 

Black is Beautiful started out as a project from Weathered Souls Brewing Co., a Texas-based black-owned brewery. The business posted their recipe for an imperial stout and encouraged other breweries to make the recipe their own and sell it under the condition that 100 percent of the proceeds would go to a cause that supports equality and inclusion, according to the company’s website.

Robby Willey, co-owner of the Virginia Beer Company, said when he and his staff heard about the movement, they knew it was important to take part.

“If a community is hurting, then we need to do our part to heal the community,” Willey said. “We want to speak up for those that don’t have a voice and we felt like the most powerful way to support that message is by donating to an organization.”

The hard part was deciding which local organization to donate to, but the brewery was quickly connected with Brian Smalls who just started a nonprofit, alongside Ebony Flake and Randall Hazard, that raises the voices of local youth through media production and education.

The idea for Media Mentors started in 2017 after Smalls realized he could do his own marketing and video production for his company, Cornerstone Estate Planners.

As a father of two, Smalls realized there was a potential to take those skills and teach them to local youth so they could build on them for future careers.

“It can be a starting place for these kids,” he said. “We look at our program almost like the traditional trade program…we think that because where technology is going in the future, teaching these skill sets will be just putting them in a position to be able to do some tremendous things.”

The organization was able to establish a nonprofit status in October 2019 and started creating programs to help youth cultivate skills regarding video production, media creation and social media marketing.

Smalls said the idea is to do that through a series of camps and classes that allows students to become familiar with the technology and learn how to potentially build a business from those skills in the future. 

The courses will have local professionals with experience in film production and social media teaching the students about their own careers and experiences as well as encouraging them to be creative in their own content.

The coronavirus pandemic has slowed down many of the organization’s plans in its first year. Instead of offering in-person training, the organization has been hosting virtual meetings and plans to continue to do so in the fall.

But it caught the attention of the Virginia Beer Company because of the recent videos it has produced in response to the May 25 death of George Floyd.

In the first video, “We Are Not Responsible,” the organization interviews white Americans on how Floyd’s death impacted them and ways to advance conversations surrounding systemic oppression.

The organization’s second video, I Can’t Breathe: A Response to the Death of George Floyd, three men, including Smalls, share their views on Floyd’s death and their own experiences with law enforcement. 

Smalls said the productions were important to the organization because its mission is to teach students how to tell their own narrative. 

“I think that when you look at what’s going on, not just in the country but in our own backyard, kids at a very early age are getting the opportunity to see history in the making,” he said. “I think far too often, especially with young people, their stories are dictated to them by people who might not understand them…So I want them to be in a position to have their voices heard.”

Smalls admitted the expenses can be a struggle being a new nonprofit with a base in technology. The organization will provide video cameras, microphones, computers and software for students to work on projects— all of which can run up a bill.

That’s why Smalls said he was more than grateful for the donations from the Virginia Beer Company. 

Willey said the business has produced 70 cases of the Black is Beautiful brew and had already sold more than half in its first week. The business took Weathered Souls’ recipe and mixed in its own flavor with its Waypost Imperial Stout. The ingredients mixed together make the beer heavy, which means it is also a little more expensive. But in the week the product has been available, Willey said customers have been happy to pay extra knowing the proceeds go to Media Mentors. 

“It’s been great being associated with this initiative,” Smalls said. “I think it’s something we are already passionate about, so it allowed us to connect with other organizations and businesses locally that are on a similar mindset in terms of social justice.”

philanthropy and media production 

oh  and beer 

the virginia beer company has partnered with a nationwide movement to sell the new “black is beautiful” brew which will benefit the new local nonprofit  media mentors  

black is beautiful started out as a project from weathered souls brewing co   a texas-based black-owned brewery  the business posted their recipe for an imperial stout and encouraged other breweries to make the recipe their own and sell it under the condition that 100 percent of the proceeds would go to a cause that supports equality and inclusion  according to the company’s website 

robby willey  co-owner of the virginia beer company  said when he and his staff heard about the movement  they knew it was important to take part 

“if a community is hurting  then we need to do our part to heal the community ” willey said  “we want to speak up for those that don’t have a voice and we felt like the most powerful way to support that message is by donating to an organization ”

the hard part was deciding which local organization to donate to  but the brewery was quickly connected with brian smalls who just started a nonprofit  alongside ebony flake and randall hazard  that raises the voices of local youth through media production and education 

the idea for media mentors started in 2017 after smalls realized he could do his own marketing and video production for his company  cornerstone estate planners 

as a father of two  smalls realized there was a potential to take those skills and teach them to local youth so they could build on them for future careers 

“it can be a starting place for these kids ” he said  “we look at our program almost like the traditional trade program…we think that because where technology is going in the future  teaching these skill sets will be just putting them in a position to be able to do some tremendous things ”

the organization was able to establish a nonprofit status in october 2019 and started creating programs to help youth cultivate skills regarding video production  media creation and social media marketing 

smalls said the idea is to do that through a series of camps and classes that allows students to become familiar with the technology and learn how to potentially build a business from those skills in the future  

the courses will have local professionals with experience in film production and social media teaching the students about their own careers and experiences as well as encouraging them to be creative in their own content

the coronavirus pandemic has slowed down many of the organization’s plans in its first year  instead of offering in-person training  the organization has been hosting virtual meetings and plans to continue to do so in the fall 

but it caught the attention of the virginia beer company because of the recent videos it has produced in response to the may 25 death of george floyd 

in the first video  “we are not responsible ” the organization interviews white americans on how floyd’s death impacted them and ways to advance conversations surrounding systemic oppression 

the organization’s second video  i can’t breathe a response to the death of george floyd  three men  including smalls  share their views on floyd’s death and their own experiences with law enforcement  

smalls said the productions were important to the organization because its mission is to teach students how to tell their own narrative  

“i think that when you look at what’s going on  not just in the country but in our own backyard  kids at a very early age are getting the opportunity to see history in the making ” he said  “i think far too often  especially with young people  their stories are dictated to them by people who might not understand them…so i want them to be in a position to have their voices heard ”

smalls admitted the expenses can be a struggle being a new nonprofit with a base in technology  the organization will provide video cameras  microphones  computers and software for students to work on projects— all of which can run up a bill 

that’s why smalls said he was more than grateful for the donations from the virginia beer company  

willey said the business has produced 70 cases of the black is beautiful brew and had already sold more than half in its first week  the business took weathered souls’ recipe and mixed in its own flavor with its waypost imperial stout  the ingredients mixed together make the beer heavy  which means it is also a little more expensive  but in the week the product has been available  willey said customers have been happy to pay extra knowing the proceeds go to media mentors  

“it’s been great being associated with this initiative ” smalls said  “i think it’s something we are already passionate about  so it allowed us to connect with other organizations and businesses locally that are on a similar mindset in terms of social justice ”

Dubbed the “Wonder Studio,”  the interactive gallery is rooted in the Chrysler’s collection and was designed with children in mind.

\
The studio consists of three components; the drawing studio, the “colorscape” and the “art-quarium.”

The studio is a space where families can visit without worry of children touching the art, said Anne Corso, director of education for the Chrysler.

“In our focus groups for this project, we heard over and over that families were scared to bring their kids here” because they were worried about their children touching the art, Corso said.

Drawing studio
The drawing studio is a series of interactive touch screens that allow visitors to add a bit of their own flair to some of the Chrysler’s masterpieces.

“The inspiration for the drawing studio is the classic art class, where you walk in and have a figure model there,” Corso said. “A blank canvas can be intimidating, so we provided images of Chrysler artworks for people to use as their canvas.”

Visitors can also create their own digital collages on the touchscreens, and those works are then displayed on large screens nearby.

Art-quarium
The art-quarium is exactly what it sounds like — a display of art that looks like an aquarium. It contains paintings, photographs, and sculpture from the Chrysler’s collection.

Like an aquarium, the artwork is sealed behind glass and objects seemingly float at varying heights, which allows kids to see the artwork up close, Corso said. Walking through the display, visitors become surrounded by artwork from the Chrysler’s collection.

Colorscape
The colorscape is big white canvas where people can paint with their bodies. Well, sort of.

The colorscape consists of a three-dimensional, u-shaped platform with two cameras perched above. When a person walks on the platform, the floor illuminates with color, reacting to that person’s movements. Accompanying sound effects create an immersive experience that combines touch, visuals and sound as visitors paint the floor with their bodies.

Ashley Gillis, a mother and local blogger, said the interactive gallery is something that she’s been looking for.

“In the past, I was a little nervous to bring my kids here, because I have a 2-year-old and she’s all over the place,” Gillis said. “I’m excited that she can explore and have fun in a place where the art is protected.”

Which is precisely what the Chrysler sought to provide with this space.

“We wanted people to feel comfortable in here, and wanted parents to know that they’re welcome here and that there’s a space for them,” Corso said.

Corso said the human form makes for a great introduction to connecting with kids about art.

“Because your body is art — and can make art, too,” she said.","['norfolk', '—', 'after', 'years', 'of', 'planning', 'and', 'focus', 'groups', 'the', 'chrysler', 'museum', 'of', 'art', 'unveiled',

the studio is a space where families can visit without worry of children touching the art  said anne corso  director of education for the chrysler 

“in our focus groups for this project  we heard over and over that families were scared to bring their kids here” because they were worried about their children touching the art  corso said

the drawing studio is a series of interactive touch screens that allow visitors to add a bit of their own flair to some of the chrysler’s masterpieces

“the inspiration for the drawing studio is the classic art class  where you walk in and have a figure model there ” corso said  “a blank canvas can be intimidating  so we provided images of chrysler artworks for people to use as their canvas ”

visitors can also create their own digital collages on the touchscreens  and those works are then displayed on large screens nearby 

art-quarium
the art-quarium is exactly what it sounds like — a display of art that looks like an aquarium  it contains paintings  photographs  and sculpture from the chrysler’s collection

like an aquarium  the artwork is sealed behind glass and objects seemingly float at varying heights  which allows kids to see the artwork up close  corso said  walking through the display  visitors become surrounded by artwork from the chrysler’s collection 

colorscape
the colorscape is big white canvas where people can paint with their bodies  well  sort of 

the colorscape consists of a three-dimensional  u-shaped platform with two cameras perched above  when a person walks on the platform  the floor illuminates with color  reacting to that person’s movements  accompanying sound effects create an immersive experience that combines touch  visuals and sound as visitors paint the floor with their bodies

ashley gillis  a mother and local blogger  said the interactive gallery is something that she’s been looking for 

“in the past  i was a little nervous to bring my kids here  because i have a 2-year-old and she’s all over the place ” gillis said  “i’m excited that she can explore and have fun in a place where the art is protected ”

which is precisely what the chrysler sought to provide with this space 

“we wanted people to feel comfortable in here  and wanted parents to know that they’re welcome here and that there’s a space for them ” corso said 

corso said the human form makes for a great introduction to connecting with kids about art

119,Google: Norfolk tech company a leader in educational technology,WYDaily,https://wydaily.com/business/2018/08/04/google-norfolk-tech-company-a-leader-in-educational-technology/,Williamsburg,08/2018,"NORFOLK — Amplified IT, an education-focused tech consultancy firm based here, recently received two distinctions for its work providing digital interactive tools in classrooms nationwide.

On July 23 in San Francisco, Amplified IT received the 2017 Google Cloud Global Partner Award for Customer Success in Google for Education, according to a Google blog on education tools.

The award highlights the company’s tech acumen, which chose Norfolk as its headquarter in 2015 because the founders were excited about the city’s burgeoning technology corridor.

“Before moving to Norfolk we met with Norfolk’s Department of Economic Development, where they laid out the plans for the future of Norfolk. We were sold,” said Tim Lee, founder and chief technology officer of Amplified IT. “We wanted to be a part of the New Energy of Norfolk.”

Amplified IT’s recognition from tech giant Google brought attention from city officials, business groups, and even Gov. Ralph Northam, who visited Amplified’s offices in Norfolk’s NEON District on Friday.

“I’m here to congratulate you for your work with Google Cloud in the classrooms of our public schools,” Northam said, standing next to Amplified IT’s co-founder Tim Lee. “Your company is truly a great success story. My goal is to make Virginia the No. 1 state to do business in, and I’m proud of companies like yours that decided to make your home here in Norfolk.”

Amplified IT has assisted more than 4,000 school districts across 46 states, playing a role in the daily education of more than 24 million students, according to a news release from the City of Norfolk.

The company assists schools in developing actionable road maps for using Google for Education technology to ensure Google products support learning initiatives, said Roz Pascasio, a regional account manager for Amplified IT.

According to the city’s news release, that guidance provided by Amplified IT empowers tech staff in schools and helps to prepare those schools to implement Google hardware and software, which teaches students invaluable literacy in subjects like digital citizenship and online ethics.

Norfolk was the right home for Amplified IT, Lee said.

“With our bike lanes, the NEON District, and things like the Elizabeth River Trail, Norfolk has created a city where we want to grow both our business and families,” Lee said. “Norfolk has delivered on their promise to turn the city into a vibrant cultural center.”","['norfolk', '—', 'amplified', 'it', 'an', 'education-focused', 'tech', 'consultancy', 'firm', 'based', 'here', 'recently',

120,Media Coverage of COVID Underserves Rural Communities,WYDaily,https://wydaily.com/news/2022/08/23/media-coverage-of-covid-underserves-rural-communities/,Williamsburg,08/2022,"RICHMOND — COVID has been in and out of the news cycle for over two years now, but that news cycle is driven by the experience in major cities. Coverage of the pandemic in rural America hasn’t kept pace.

That disparity has had consequences — both for how rural Americans view the pandemic, and how prepared regional hospitals were for local virus outbreaks.

As America shut down in 2020 during the initial COVID wave in large cities, rural Virginia hospitals followed the same protocols and stopped doing routine procedures, even when local COVID cases were low.

The lack of revenue from routine care led first to layoffs, and eventually to the resumption of procedures. Wendy Welch — executive director of the Southwest Virginia Graduate Medical Education Consortium — said after that, COVID showed up.

“They started doing procedures about a month before they got hit by the first wave of COVID,” said Welch, “and then they had to stop doing the procedures again. So, it was almost the worst-case scenario — your hospital was full of people, and then suddenly, your hospital was full of COVID.”

Welch said the delays in COVID waves have been consistent over the entire pandemic, and the current outbreak in southwest Virginia is on an upswing.

As thousands of local and regional newspapers have shut down, local news coverage has suffered and more distant media outlets aren’t making up the difference.

Rural residents may see major media covering COVID stories in large cities when not much is happening locally — and then, as media attention turns to other topics, a virus surge hits rural areas.

Welch said that process has ended up spreading confusion.

“We’re going up where other places are going down,” said Welch, “and we’re late, because we are more rural. And this has driven up the ability to misinform people about COVID overall in rural areas, because we don’t conform to the major patterns you see on the news.”

The ongoing incongruity between media attention and COVID reality in rural places has created space for misinformation to take hold. Welch said as the pandemic continues, those ideas have evolved.

“The misinformation is predominantly around the vaccine,” said Welch. “You don’t have a lot of people left who are saying there’s no such thing as COVID, I mean, for a while there, it was called the ‘election virus’ — it would go away after the 2020 election. People kind of don’t say that anymore.”

The state as a whole is still reporting around 2,500 COVID cases a day, but rural areas in southwestern Virginia are reporting the highest numbers per capita.","['richmond', '—', 'covid', 'has', 'been', 'in', 'and', 'out', 'of', 'the', 'news', 'cycle', 'for', 'over', 'two', 'years', 'now', 'but', 'that', 'news', 'cycle', 'is', 'driven', 'by', 'the', 'experience', 'in', 'major', 'cities', 'coverage', 'of', 'the', 'pandemic', 'in', 'rural', 'america', 'hasn’t', 'kept', 'pace', 'that', 'disparity', 'has', 'had', 'consequences', '—', 'both', 'for', 'how', 'rural', 'americans', 'view', 'the', 'pandemic', 'and', 'how', 'prepared', 'regional', 'hospitals', 'were', 'for', 'local', 'virus', 'outbreaks', 'more', 'on', 'wydaily', '✕', 'colonial', 'williamsburg', 'to', 'celebrate', 'native', 'american', 'heritage', 'month', 'throughout', 'november', 'trackerdslogo', 'as', 'america', 'shut', 'down', 'in', '2020', 'during', 'the', 'initial', 'covid', 'wave', 'in', 'large', 'cities', 'rural', 'virginia', 'hospitals', 'followed', 'the', 'same', 'protocols', 'and', 'stopped', 'doing', 'routine', 'procedures', 'even', 'when', 'local', 'covid', 'cases', 'were', 'low', 'the', 'lack', 'of', 'revenue', 'from', 'routine', 'care', 'led', 'first', 'to', 'layoffs', 'and', 'eventually', 'to', 'the', 'resumption', 'of', 'procedures', 'wendy', 'welch', '—', 'executive', 'director', 'of', 'the', 'southwest', 'virginia', 'graduate', 'medical', 'education', 'consortium', '—', 'said', 'after', 'that', 'covid', 'showed', 'up', '“they', 'started', 'doing', 'procedures', 'about', 'a', 'month', 'before', 'they', 'got', 'hit', 'by', 'the', 'first', 'wave', 'of', 'covid', '”', 'said', 'welch', '“and', 'then', 'they', 'had', 'to', 'stop', 'doing', 'the', 'procedures', 'again', 'so', 'it', 'was', 'almost', 'the', 'worst-case', 'scenario', '—', 'your', 'hospital', 'was', 'full', 'of', 'people', 'and', 'then', 'suddenly', 'your', 'hospital', 'was', 'full', 'of', 'covid', '”', 'welch', 'said', 'the', 'delays', 'in', 'covid', 'waves', 'have', 'been', 'consistent', 'over', 'the', 'entire', 'pandemic', 'and', 'the', 'current', 'outbreak', 'in', 'southwest', 'virginia', 'is', 'on', 'an', 'upswing', 'as', 'thousands', 'of', 'local', 'and', 'regional', 'newspapers', 'have', 'shut', 'down', 'local', 'news', 'coverage', 'has', 'suffered', 'and', 'more', 'distant', 'media', 'outlets', 'aren’t', 'making', 'up', 'the', 'difference', 'rural', 'residents', 'may', 'see', 'major', 'media', 'covering', 'covid', 'stories', 'in', 'large', 'cities', 'when', 'not', 'much', 'is', 'happening', 'locally', '—', 'and', 'then', 'as', 'media', 'attention', 'turns', 'to', 'other', 'topics', 'a', 'virus', 'surge', 'hits', 'rural', 'areas', 'welch', 'said', 'that', 'process', 'has', 'ended', 'up', 'spreading', 'confusion', '“we’re', 'going', 'up', 'where', 'other', 'places', 'are', 'going', 'down', '”', 'said', 'welch', '“and', 'we’re', 'late', 'because', 'we', 'are', 'more', 'rural', 'and', 'this', 'has', 'driven', 'up', 'the', 'ability', 'to', 'misinform', 'people', 'about', 'covid', 'overall', 'in', 'rural', 'areas', 'because', 'we', 'don’t', 'conform', 'to', 'the', 'major', 'patterns', 'you', 'see', 'on', 'the', 'news', '”', 'the', 'ongoing', 'incongruity', 'between', 'media', 'attention', 'and', 'covid', 'reality', 'in', 'rural', 'places', 'has', 'created', 'space', 'for', 'misinformation', 'to', 'take', 'hold', 'welch', 'said', 'as', 'the', 'pandemic', 'continues', 'those', 'ideas', 'have', 'evolved', '“the', 'misinformation', 'is', 'predominantly', 'around', 'the', 'vaccine', '”', 'said', 'welch', '“you', 'don’t', 'have', 'a', 'lot', 'of', 'people', 'left', 'who', 'are', 'saying', 'there’s', 'no', 'such', 'thing', 'as', 'covid', 'i', 'mean', 'for', 'a', 'while', 'there', 'it', 'was', 'called', 'the', '‘election', 'virus’', '—', 'it', 'would', 'go', 'away', 'after', 'the', '2020', 'election', 'people', 'kind', 'of', 'don’t', 'say', 'that', 'anymore', '”', 'the', 'state', 'as', 'a', 'whole', 'is', 'still', 'reporting', 'around', '2', '500', 'covid', 'cases', 'a', 'day', 'but', 'rural', 'areas', 'in', 'southwestern', 'virginia', 'are', 'reporting', 'the', 'highest', 'numbers', 'per', 'capita']","['driven', 'prepared', 'large', 'even', 'consistent', 'large', 'surge', 'driven', 'ability', 'kind']","['virus', 'down', 'low', 'lack', 'outbreak', 'down', 'virus', 'confusion', 'down', 'mean']",8.0,2022.0,"richmond — covid has been in and out of the news cycle for over two years now  but that news cycle is driven by the experience in major cities  coverage of the pandemic in rural america hasn’t kept pace

121,W&M Global Film Festival Expanded and Rebranded to Ampersand International Arts Festival,WYDaily,https://wydaily.com/our-community/2022/04/01/wm-global-film-festival-expanded-and-rebranded-to-ampersand-international-arts-festival/,Williamsburg,04/2022,"WILLIAMSBURG — In its fifteenth year, the William & Mary Global Film Festival has rebranded and expanded to what is now the Ampersand International Arts Festival.

Presented by William & Mary (W&M), the Ampersand International Arts Festival will feature over 60 programs over five days, April 6-10.

“For years, the festival has incorporated programming across all arts into the lineup,” Adam Stackhouse, co-producer of the festival, said. “Theatre, music, dance and writing has all been in there. And we thought this would show that diversity of the fields we’re incorporating into the festival. We’re looking to acknowledge it more to recognize this festival is showcasing arts across all spectrums.”

While film is still a major part of the festival, Stackhouse said that other elements that have been growing over the years will play a larger role in the festival.

The name “Ampersand” is both a nod to W&M’s iconic symbol and the cross-collaborative nature of the event.

“We very much look at it as a town gown festival,” Stackhouse said.

With sponsors including the City of Williamsburg, W&M and Colonial Williamsburg, the event takes place both on-campus and off-campus at about 15 venues around Williamsburg.

“We’re very happy to be using the Amphitheater at Lake Matoaka every evening,” Liz Sykes, co-producer of the festival, said. “So we will have movie screenings there as well as music.”

The event will also feature collaborations between arts groups.

“That’s really the goal is to just talk about what we’re all doing and create a platform for people to showcase what they’re working on,” Sykes said.

Sykes said that those who attended previous festivals can expect the same number of films and style of films, with W&M faculty introducing some of the films.

The festival has also expanded the films this year by adding a track of anniversary screenings held in Hennage Auditorium, inside the Art Museums of Colonial Williamsburg, 301 S Nassau St.

“There’s a diverse slate of programming that kind of covers all demographics,” Stackhouse said. “Students tend to come out to things where they can see performance groups or more popular movies that have been on their radar. And the Williamsburg population tends to be pretty brave in seeing our more art house cinema, or international films and documentaries. Then some of the big international films that you see at the Oscars, those tend to be a hit across both groups.”

In addition to films, theatre, and music, the festival will also include author talks, workshops, panels, receptions and more.

“I’m looking forward to the receptions we’re able to bing back this year because it’s a nice way for people to connect,” Sykes said.

The expanded festival will also include an arts and entertainment industry summit and Q&A panel with alum.

“That’s something we really want to continue to grow is making those connections between alumni and current students, to help them get internship opportunities and jobs,” Sykes said.

The festival will still feature a virtual format, with attendees able to access films on a streaming platform. Some of the panels will be virtual as well.

“That was actually a silver lining of some of what we had to do to adapt to the pandemic last year,” Sykes said. “We realized we could actually get a lot more alumni involved through the virtual component, because many of them are enthusiastic about supporting the festival, but they are on the west coast or they are just not able to travel to Williamsburg.”

presented by william & mary (w&m)  the ampersand international arts festival will feature over 60 programs over five days  april 6-10 

“for years  the festival has incorporated programming across all arts into the lineup ” adam stackhouse  co-producer of the festival  said  “theatre  music  dance and writing has all been in there  and we thought this would show that diversity of the fields we’re incorporating into the festival  we’re looking to acknowledge it more to recognize this festival is showcasing arts across all spectrums ”

while film is still a major part of the festival  stackhouse said that other elements that have been growing over the years will play a larger role in the festival 

the name “ampersand” is both a nod to w&m’s iconic symbol and the cross-collaborative nature of the event 


the festival will take place at venues all around williamsburg  (courtesy of avadventure productions)
“we very much look at it as a town gown festival ” stackhouse said 

with sponsors including the city of williamsburg  w&m and colonial williamsburg  the event takes place both on-campus and off-campus at about 15 venues around williamsburg 

“we’re very happy to be using the amphitheater at lake matoaka every evening ” liz sykes  co-producer of the festival  said  “so we will have movie screenings there as well as music ”

the event will also feature collaborations between arts groups 

“that’s really the goal is to just talk about what we’re all doing and create a platform for people to showcase what they’re working on ” sykes said 

sykes said that those who attended previous festivals can expect the same number of films and style of films  with w&m faculty introducing some of the films 

the festival has also expanded the films this year by adding a track of anniversary screenings held in hennage auditorium  inside the art museums of colonial williamsburg  301 s nassau st 

“there’s a diverse slate of programming that kind of covers all demographics ” stackhouse said  “students tend to come out to things where they can see performance groups or more popular movies that have been on their radar  and the williamsburg population tends to be pretty brave in seeing our more art house cinema  or international films and documentaries  then some of the big international films that you see at the oscars  those tend to be a hit across both groups ”

in addition to films  theatre  and music  the festival will also include author talks  workshops  panels  receptions and more 

“i’m looking forward to the receptions we’re able to bing back this year because it’s a nice way for people to connect ” sykes said 

the expanded festival will also include an arts and entertainment industry summit and q&a panel with alum 

“that’s something we really want to continue to grow is making those connections between alumni and current students  to help them get internship opportunities and jobs ” sykes said 

the festival will still feature a virtual format  with attendees able to access films on a streaming platform  some of the panels will be virtual as well 

“that was actually a silver lining of some of what we had to do to adapt to the pandemic last year ” sykes said  “we realized we could actually get a lot more alumni involved through the virtual component  because many of them are enthusiastic about supporting the festival  but they are on the west coast or they are just not able to travel to williamsburg ”

122,‘COLORS’ Exhibit to Feature Local Artists,WYDaily,https://wydaily.com/our-community/2022/03/15/colors-art-exhibit-to-feature-local-artists/,Williamsburg,03/2022,"WILLIAMSBURG — Two local artists, Connie Desaulniers and Kathy Hornsby, will feature their artwork together in an upcoming art show at the Stryker Center.

From April 9 to May 28, 2022, the art show, “COLORS,” is the first collaborative exhibit between the two local artists.

Hornsby will feature some of her latest photography work, which includes the use of colorful florals that are positioned underwater. By the use of lighting, water, and color, Hornsby adds a unique, almost paint-like, effect.

Desaulniers, a painter, describes her own artwork by the way she approaches her techniques. She uses rich, dense, and saturated colors to add her own vibrant signature to the pieces that she creates.

“We’re great partners in this,” said Desaulniers in an interview with WYDaily. “She’s got strength in areas and I have strength in areas, and our work compliments each other very well. Plus we have a really good time and that’s what is the best part about all of this.”

The two artists will donate a percentage of the net proceeds made from the art show to the Stryker Center to help promote future art shows at the gallery.

“They’ve got a fabulous art space with natural lighting and really nice interior lights for nighttime, as well as great walls where you can exhibit,” said Desaulniers. “It’s a hidden jewel. We’re really excited and one of the things we hope to do is help the area realize what a great art venue it is.”

The show is presented by The Optimal Service Group of Wells Fargo Advisors. Desaulniers said this will help with keeping the artists’ costs down and will enable them to give more back to the Stryker Art Gallery.

“There’s definitely been a movement recently to build visibility of Williamsburg art,” said Desaulniers. “There’s a lot of artists in our community who may be uncomfortable with getting out and doing something like this, but they’re excellent artists. We would love to be able to inspire them to get out and show their work.”

In addition to the featured paintings and photography, the artists will sell their limited-edition cashmere scarves. The scarves feature digital prints of paintings and photographs created by Hornsby and Desaulniers.

The opening day for “COLORS” takes place on Saturday, April 9, from 12-5 p.m. The two artists will also be at the exhibit on April 24 from 10 a.m. – 5 p.m., which will coincide with the “Art on the Square” juried art show.

The last day to view the exhibit is on May 28 from 12 p.m. – 5 p.m.

The Linda Matney Gallery, located at 5435 Richmond Rd., Suite A, in Williamsburg, develops thematic group shows and collaborative art projects with local artists as well as artists from all over.


The current Linda Matney Gallery exhibition features art work from W&M senior art majors and features a diverse investigation into the foundational and observational practices of art making, Associate Professor of Art from W&M’s Department of Art & Art History Nicole Santiago said.

“In many of the works, one finds a sort of conceptual challenge that often raises more questions than answers—asking the viewer to dig deeper,” Santiago said.

From now through March 27, the public can view the work of Khadija Bea, Isabelle Gareis, Carter Helmandollar, Avery Hines, Jarvis Hua, Litzy Morales, Laura Reitze, Martha Rose, Angel Valdez-Machicado and Jieru Zhang.

Gallery owner and curator John Lee Matney is available in person or by Zoom to discuss the exhibition by appointment or during the gallery’s hours.

“I am excited to see how the students will engage with our patrons and collectors via these works, and their other efforts toward the exhibition,” Matney said. “We plan to have additional events at the gallery and special presentations for the public art collectors, patrons, and students.”

The senior showcase features a diversity of art styles, including mixed media, oil on canvas and charcoal.

“This show has been a pivotal experience for many of the students,” Santiago said. “Beyond the excitement of showing in a commercial gallery, they have also garnered a competency with essential exhibiting skills: framing, presentation, installation, and publicity.”

The exhibition is open to the public through March 27.

126,Art History Students Get Hands-On Curatorial Experience at W&M’s Muscarelle Museum of Art,WYDaily,https://wydaily.com/our-community/2022/04/09/art-history-students-get-hands-on-curatorial-experience-at-wms-muscarelle-museum-of-art/,Williamsburg,04/2022,"WILLIAMSBURG — Students curating a museum exhibition at William & Mary (W&M) get the full experience.

This includes choosing artwork, writing accompanying text and deciding on placement in the gallery — all while working with the on-campus Muscarelle Museum of Art’s collection, galleries and curatorial staff.

“It’s a relatively new course in our curriculum — a response to our students’ interest in museum work and to the availability of the Muscarelle Museum of Art, our university museum, which takes very seriously its role as a laboratory for learning,” said Charles Palermo, professor of art history, who is teaching the course for the first time this semester as part of a rotation of faculty members who do so.

The Curatorial Project is a required practicum course for art history majors that is taught each spring in collaboration with the Muscarelle.

This year the coursework will culminate in the opening of “The Curatorial Project: Leonard Baskin” on April 15 at the Muscarelle. Students will give presentations there on April 25 at 3:30 p.m. as part of Undergraduate Research Month.

“I am thrilled to have the opportunity to get experience in a museum itself and outside of the classroom,” said Ivana Genov ’23. “Presenting at the Muscarelle is a great way for students to get familiar with the workings and environment of a museum and better understand the curatorial process. Additionally, the museum staff seems delighted to have us, (is) genuinely excited about our exhibit and conveys complete confidence in our abilities to curate a great show.”

After studying the history, theory and politics of curating, students went on to apply what they’d learned in the hands-on curating of the exhibition. The course combines critical readings, classroom discussion, writing, exhibition design and implementation.

Students selected, researched, documented and wrote texts for this exhibition from the Muscarelle’s growing collection of works by Baskin, a mid-century American artist best known for his works on paper and his bleak portrayals of the human figure.

“In addition to hosting their exhibition, the museum has a unique role in working with students from the Curatorial Project by providing first-hand interaction with primary source materials and art objects to directly support their research,” said Melissa Parris, the Muscarelle’s deputy director of collections, exhibitions and operations.

“Close engagement with the objects also gives students the opportunity to learn archival methods, proper handling and best practices in museum work — all of which are foundations for curatorship.”

Alice Baughman ’24 said she has enjoyed the hands-on work in the museum the most.

“It’s an extremely valuable experience as a student of art history to learn directly from professionals about the timeline, process and analytical work of curation,” Baughman said.

Faculty members teaching the course set the framework, and Palermo chose the prints of Baskin, calling him “an important post-war U.S. sculptor.” His choice was prompted by recent Baskin additions to the museum’s existing collection and the discovery that W&M Libraries’ Special Collections Research Center had a few of Baskin’s collaborations with poets as well as his book illustrations.

“The course aims to get the students to do approximately the kinds of things curators do in museums as they prepare an exhibition,” Palermo said.

This included looking over the works at the Muscarelle and Swem Library, researching Baskin’s career and discovering writing on its major themes and on Baskin’s collaborations and preoccupations, according to Palermo.

“Researching Baskin and trying to figure out what key elements of his work and life to share has been a challenge in the best way,” Baughman said. “There are no specific guidelines for what information has already been deemed ‘most important,’ so we get to discuss, investigate and puzzle through our understanding of Baskin’s motives, style and message.”

For Genov, doing a deep dive on Baskin has been incredibly gratifying because it is a practical examination of his life’s work in a way that is very different from what students do in other classes.

“We are specifically researching him in order to best display his work thematically and to write interesting but succinct information about him that is appealing to the average museum-goer,” Genov said. “This goal and manner of framing our work is a new challenge for students who are generally required to write lengthy papers demonstrating intense knowledge on a single subject centered around a thesis.”

Through proposals and discussions, the students selected the title “The Human Frame” and organized themselves into groups with assigned topics to guide the design of the exhibition space.

“The Curatorial Project is a remarkable opportunity for students to get hands-on experience in a museum, with real pieces of art, to tackle the challenges that come with curating an exhibit,” Genov said. “From very official projects like press releases and wall text, to the mundane tasks of researching and corresponding with staff, the class is very student-led in which it is up to us to delegate work and meet deadlines under the guidance of Professor Palermo.”

Working closely as a team allowed students to identify one another’s strengths to best delegate the tasks, according to Genov.

“This experience has not only brought me closer to my fellow classmates at W&M, but has also made me feel more confident about entering the field of art history with goals of museum work and curation in mind,” Genov said.

Staff members from the Muscarelle and W&M Libraries assisted with various steps while working alongside students. This ranged from looking over and discussing plans to helping to prepare works from Special Collections for inclusion in the show to matting and framing works prior to installation.

“Being able to interact with the pieces we’re studying in person is an incredible addition to our course and adds a perspective that art history students don’t always have, given that the pieces we study are all over the world and we often analyze photos or scans rather than the real works,” Baughman said.

“Additionally, the team working at the Muscarelle gives us practical advice and guidance that helps us learn more about the work of professional curators. This class is unlike any other — it is more involved, practical and student-led, and is a crucial part of William & Mary’s art history major.”","['williamsburg', '—', 'students', 'curating', 'a',

“it’s a relatively new course in our curriculum — a response to our students’ interest in museum work and to the availability of the muscarelle museum of art  our university museum  which takes very seriously its role as a laboratory for learning ” said charles palermo  professor of art history  who is teaching the course for the first time this semester as part of a rotation of faculty members who do so 

the curatorial project is a required practicum course for art history majors that is taught each spring in collaboration with the muscarelle 

this year the coursework will culminate in the opening of “the curatorial project leonard baskin” on april 15 at the muscarelle  students will give presentations there on april 25 at 330 p m  as part of undergraduate research month 

“i am thrilled to have the opportunity to get experience in a museum itself and outside of the classroom ” said ivana genov ’23  “presenting at the muscarelle is a great way for students to get familiar with the workings and environment of a museum and better understand the curatorial process  additionally  the museum staff seems delighted to have us  (is) genuinely excited about our exhibit and conveys complete confidence in our abilities to curate a great show ”

after studying the history  theory and politics of curating  students went on to apply what they’d learned in the hands-on curating of the exhibition  the course combines critical readings  classroom discussion  writing  exhibition design and implementation 

students selected  researched  documented and wrote texts for this exhibition from the muscarelle’s growing collection of works by baskin  a mid-century american artist best known for his works on paper and his bleak portrayals of the human figure 

“in addition to hosting their exhibition  the museum has a unique role in working with students from the curatorial project by providing first-hand interaction with primary source materials and art objects to directly support their research ” said melissa parris  the muscarelle’s deputy director of collections  exhibitions and operations 

“close engagement with the objects also gives students the opportunity to learn archival methods  proper handling and best practices in museum work — all of which are foundations for curatorship ”

alice baughman ’24 said she has enjoyed the hands-on work in the museum the most 

“it’s an extremely valuable experience as a student of art history to learn directly from professionals about the timeline  process and analytical work of curation ” baughman said

faculty members teaching the course set the framework  and palermo chose the prints of baskin  calling him “an important post-war u s  sculptor ” his choice was prompted by recent baskin additions to the museum’s existing collection and the discovery that w&m libraries’ special collections research center had a few of baskin’s collaborations with poets as well as his book illustrations 

“the course aims to get the students to do approximately the kinds of things curators do in museums as they prepare an exhibition ” palermo said 

this included looking over the works at the muscarelle and swem library  researching baskin’s career and discovering writing on its major themes and on baskin’s collaborations and preoccupations  according to palermo 

“researching baskin and trying to figure out what key elements of his work and life to share has been a challenge in the best way ” baughman said  “there are no specific guidelines for what information has already been deemed ‘most important ’ so we get to discuss  investigate and puzzle through our understanding of baskin’s motives  style and message ”

for genov  doing a deep dive on baskin has been incredibly gratifying because it is a practical examination of his life’s work in a way that is very different from what students do in other classes 

“we are specifically researching him in order to best display his work thematically and to write interesting but succinct information about him that is appealing to the average museum-goer ” genov said  “this goal and manner of framing our work is a new challenge for students who are generally required to write lengthy papers demonstrating intense knowledge on a single subject centered around a thesis ”

through proposals and discussions  the students selected the title “the human frame” and organized themselves into groups with assigned topics to guide the design of the exhibition space 

“the curatorial project is a remarkable opportunity for students to get hands-on experience in a museum  with real pieces of art  to tackle the challenges that come with curating an exhibit ” genov said  “from very official projects like press releases and wall text  to the mundane tasks of researching and corresponding with staff  the class is very student-led in which it is up to us to delegate work and meet deadlines under the guidance of professor palermo ”

working closely as a team allowed students to identify one another’s strengths to best delegate the tasks  according to genov 


students work together to research  analyze and choose which information to include in the final exhibition as part of the curatorial project course  (photo by stephen salpukas)
“this experience has not only brought me closer to my fellow classmates at w&m  but has also made me feel more confident about entering the field of art history with goals of museum work and curation in mind ” genov said 

staff members from the muscarelle and w&m libraries assisted with various steps while working alongside students  this ranged from looking over and discussing plans to helping to prepare works from special collections for inclusion in the show to matting and framing works prior to installation 

“being able to interact with the pieces we’re studying in person is an incredible addition to our course and adds a perspective that art history students don’t always have  given that the pieces we study are all over the world and we often analyze photos or scans rather than the real works ” baughman said 

“additionally  the team working at the muscarelle gives us practical advice and guidance that helps us learn more about the work of professional curators  this class is unlike any other — it is more involved  practical and student-led  and is a crucial part of william & mary’s art history major ”","['ate', 'be ', 'been', 'che', 'class', 'dis', 'fam', 'hip', 'ice ', 'inclusion', 'inclusion', 'ion', 'lit', 'n', 'nd', 'paper ', 'rack', 'real ', 'read', 'sis', 'tea', 'tense ', 'tho', 'unity ', '', '', '', '', '', '']",43,8,30,1158

128,Growing requests for county’s speed trailer prompts new technology in neighborhoods,WYDaily,https://wydaily.com/news/local/2019/05/28/growing-requests-for-countys-speed-trailer-prompts-new-technology-in-neighborhoods/,Williamsburg,05/2019,"An influx of reports of speeding cars in York County neighborhoods has prompted local law enforcement to invest in new technology to curb the issue.

The York-Poquoson Sheriff’s Office has bought two electronic speed signs and data-gathering devices to install in county neighborhoods, department spokesman Capt. Dennis Ivey said.

“We’re finding there are more and more speeding complaints,” Ivey said. “Sheriff (Danny) Diggs is very concerned about the safety in these neighborhoods.”

The digital signs were purchased for about $2,500 each — “a good bang for the buck,” Ivey said — in response to an increasing demand for the county’s speed camera trailer.

The sheriff’s office only has one speed trailer — and is “significantly” more expensive than the speed signs — so the sheriff’s office decided to meet the demand with new equipment.

“You need to hook the trailer up to a truck and tow it places,” Ivey said, adding the trailers aren’t as “user-friendly.” “It takes more than just putting it up on a pole like these.”

The new speed signs are removable, so the sheriff’s office can move them to different neighborhoods as-needed, Ivey said. The speed signs will be placed in certain locations based on deputy patrol reports, complaints from residents and the amount of traffic in an area.

So far, the sheriff’s office has put one speed sign in Queens Lake, Edgehill and Lakeside Drive. The department has not yet used the other sign that was purchased.

While the cameras are a lower-cost option compared to buying another speed trailer, they can do some things the trailer cannot: they track traffic numbers and assess the speed of different vehicles.

That technology will help the sheriff’s office determine where people are actually speeding and develop ways to enforce existing speed limits, Ivey said.

“It’s not being used to take a picture and send anyone a ticket,” Ivey noted. “This is an awareness and data-gathering device.”","['an', 'influx', 'of', 'reports', 'of', 'speeding', 'cars', 'in', 'york', 'county', 'neighborhoods', 'has', 'prompted', 'local', 'law', 'enforcement', 'to', 'invest', 'in', 'new', 'technology', 'to', 'curb', 'the', 'issue', 'the', 'york-poquoson', 'sheriff’s', 'office', 'has', 'bought', 'two', 'electronic', 'speed', 'signs', 'and', 'data-gathering', 'devices', 'to', 'install', 'in', 'county', 'neighborhoods', 'department', 'spokesman', 'capt', 'dennis', 'ivey', 'said', '“we’re', 'finding', 'there', 'are', 'more', 'and', 'more', 'speeding', 'complaints', '”', 'ivey', 'said', '“sheriff', '(danny)', 'diggs', 'is', 'very', 'concerned', 'about', 'the', 'safety', 'in', 'these', 'neighborhoods', '”', 'the', 'digital', 'signs', 'were', 'purchased', 'for', 'about', '$2', '500', 'each', '—', '“a', 'good', 'bang', 'for', 'the', 'buck', '”', 'ivey', 'said', '—', 'in', 'response', 'to', 'an', 'increasing', 'demand', 'for', 'the', 'county’s', 'speed', 'camera', 'trailer', 'the', 'sheriff’s', 'office', 'only', 'has', 'one', 'speed', 'trailer', '—', 'and', 'is', '“significantly”', 'more', 'expensive', 'than', 'the', 'speed', 'signs', '—', 'so', 'the', 'sheriff’s', 'office', 'decided', 'to', 'meet', 'the', 'demand', 'with', 'new', 'equipment', '“you', 'need', 'to', 'hook', 'the', 'trailer', 'up', 'to', 'a', 'truck', 'and', 'tow', 'it', 'places', '”', 'ivey', 'said', 'adding', 'the', 'trailers', 'aren’t', 'as', '“user-friendly', '”', '“it', 'takes', 'more', 'than', 'just', 'putting', 'it', 'up', 'on', 'a', 'pole', 'like', 'these', '”', 'the', 'new', 'speed', 'signs', 'are', 'removable', 'so', 'the', 'sheriff’s', 'office', 'can', 'move', 'them', 'to', 'different', 'neighborhoods', 'as-needed', 'ivey', 'said', 'the', 'speed', 'signs', 'will', 'be', 'placed', 'in', 'certain', 'locations', 'based', 'on', 'deputy', 'patrol', 'reports', 'complaints', 'from', 'residents', 'and', 'the', 'amount', 'of', 'traffic', 'in', 'an', 'area', 'so', 'far', 'the', 'sheriff’s', 'office', 'has', 'put', 'one', 'speed', 'sign', 'in', 'queens', 'lake', 'edgehill', 'and', 'lakeside', 'drive', 'the', 'department', 'has', 'not', 'yet', 'used', 'the', 'other', 'sign', 'that', 'was', 'purchased', 'while', 'the', 'cameras', 'are', 'a', 'lower-cost', 'option', 'compared', 'to', 'buying', 'another', 'speed', 'trailer', 'they', 'can', 'do', 'some', 'things', 'the', 'trailer', 'cannot', 'they', 'track', 'traffic', 'numbers', 'and', 'assess', 'the', 'speed', 'of', 'different', 'vehicles', 'that', 'technology', 'will', 'help', 'the', 'sheriff’s', 'office', 'determine', 'where', 'people', 'are', 'actually', 'speeding', 'and', 'develop', 'ways', 'to', 'enforce', 'existing', 'speed', 'limits', 'ivey', 'said', '“it’s', 'not', 'being', 'used', 'to', 'take', 'a', 'picture', 'and', 'send', 'anyone', 'a', 'ticket', '”', 'ivey', 'noted', '“this', 'is', 'an', 'awareness', 'and', 'data-gathering', 'device', '”']","['good', 'just', 'will', 'drive', 'will', 'help']","['complaints', 'expensive', 'need', 'complaints']",5.0,2019.0,"an influx of reports of speeding cars in york county neighborhoods has prompted local law enforcement to invest in new technology to curb the issue

Food Truck Tracker: Here’s What Food Trucks in the Area are Doing

(WYDaily/Dominic Catacora)
The mural, “Flight of the Honeybee, circa. 1622,” was designed and hand-painted by artist Emma Zahren-Newman. The now colorful city wall displays native plants and pollinators at a time when the first European honeybees were introduced to the area, around the year 1622.

“It’s kind of surreal. My family has been visiting over the years and we were just commenting this morning on how this used to be such a drab wall, and honestly even just starting the process of power washing it, I was like, ‘Okay, this is going to be great,'” said Zahren-Newman in an interview with WYDaily. “We cleaned it first, and then just put in the first layer of blue. Every layer just felt like such an improvement of what we had here.

“I’m glad that we have a system now where artists can share their visions. The city and the public arts council are actively looking for that, which is amazing because this is a really great community,” added Zahren-Newman. “We have a lot to share and we’re a modern city as well as a historic city. So I like that they give attention to that kind of meaning.”

Zahren-Newman studied 2D studio art at the College of William & Mary (W&M). The artist received a master’s degree in education and has taught students at WJCC Public Schools.

At about the same time, she met Glenn and Sherri Lavender, the owners of Silver Hand Meadery. She worked part-time at the meadery, and also volunteered with the James City County’s Clean County Commission, where she acted as a co-chair. By coincidence, one of the Clean County Commission programs she worked on was a project about local pollinators, the theme of the public mural project.


(WYDaily/Dominic Catacora)
“I think with the last couple of years of having everyone locked up inside and stuff, having these bright colors and life and vibrancy painted on the wall is just such a gift,” said Glenn Lavender. “I love traveling and getting to see places that have a real artsy look and vibe to them. So, for us to kind of be leading the way with that, in Williamsburg, it’s just awesome to have the first mural here, and I know we have a lot more coming too from the public arts council.”

The mural was first proposed in Sept. 2021 as part of WPAC’s early efforts to bring art to public areas around the city. The art council has also been in the process of launching another mural project in Midtown Row. The proposed spot is a wall located across from Sal’s By Victor. Work may soon be underway, once details are finalized with the city.

“The sky is the limit. The public arts council really did approve this as their very first endeavor,” said Williamsburg City Council Member Caleb Rogers in an interview with WYDaily. “We have a lot of other areas that they’re looking at for public art. We see in other towns like Decatur, Georgia, or Beaufort, South Carolina, that public art like this really contributes to the vibrancy of an area. It makes people want to visit and then come back if they’re tourists. So our hope is that the success from Silver Hand Meadery’s unveiling here, and the permanent installation, will encourage more places in the city to pursue mural or sculpture work as well.”","['williamsburg', '—', 'the', 'city', 'of', 'williamsburg', 'celebrated', 'the', 'completion', 'of', 'the', 'first', 'public', 'mural', 'approved', 'by', 'the', 'williamsburg', 'public',

137,Virginia Beach native Pharrell Williams sees new media industry for the state,WYDaily,https://wydaily.com/news/local/2018/06/25/virginia-beach-native-pharrell-williams-sees-new-media-industry-for-the-state/,Williamsburg,06/2018,"VIRGINIA BEACH — Pharrell Williams and his wife Helen hosted more than 70 state and regional leaders to discuss Virginia’s opportunities to capitalize on the expanding global demand for content and media technology.

Williams — a globally-acclaimed Virginia Beach-born musician, producer and entrepreneur — seeks to bring specific transformative business opportunities to the state, according to a news release from the city.

More on WYDaily

“We are on the map, but now it’s time to put our rich landscape, our people and their passion to work to make the Commonwealth a global destination,” Williams said. “This is my mission for Virginia, and I am not alone in seeing the vastness of this opportunity.”

Williams also met with Gov. Ralph Northam and delivered a letter from several major studios and media companies expressing interest in Virginia opportunities. Companies included Netflix, Illumination Entertainment, Universal Pictures, Endeavor and 20th Century Fox.

Williams co-produced the Oscar-nominated film, “Hidden Figures,” the true story of three female mathematicians from Virginia whose computations enabled NASA and John Glenn to orbit the earth and return safely.

Williams issued this statement:

“When I visited the set, I could sense the energy. There was so much vibrant, productive enthusiasm being harnessed by the team to tell an important story. I saw a beautiful cross section of people — young, old and diverse. I met kids fresh out of film school getting their start. There were single moms providing for their young families. Their focus and teamwork and often unspoken language felt like a glimpse into a beautiful, collaborative future workplace. It’s clear to me that this generation is passionate about a new type of manufacturing for the modern era. This generation manufactures content, and it’s just as noble as anything before it. Their final product informs, inspires, motivates and promotes empathy. But the work itself is powerful enough to forever shift the economic trajectory of an entire state. As I stood on set among all of this positivity and productive energy, I asked myself: Why were we telling a Hampton Roads’ story in Atlanta?”

“These are the types of jobs in advanced manufacturing and technology that we want to grow in Virginia,” said Virginia Beach Economic Development Director Warren D. Harris. “These jobs create transferable skills into defense, medical, A.I. and autonomous technology.”

Currently 34 states have tax credit or grant programs to recruit film production.

Virginia film industry
In 2016, Virginia’s production industry had a total economic impact of $696.8 million, provided 4,287 high-paying, full-time equivalent jobs to Virginians and contributed $27.1 million in state tax revenue, according to a news release. Virginia created a modest film tax credit program in 2011. Every $1 Virginia has invested in content incentives has returned $11 to Virginia’s economy — plus significant tourism added-value deliverables.

Some recent Virginia-filmed projects include:

139,New Colonial Williamsburg Art Exhibit Highlights The Work Of Black Artists,Peninsula Chronicle,https://peninsulachronicle.com/2022/10/24/new-colonial-williamsburg-art-exhibit-highlights-the-work-of-black-artists/,Williamsburg,10/2022,"WILLIAMSBURG-A new art exhibit that debuted at The Art Museums of Colonial Williamsburg on Saturday, October 22, is celebrating the talents of Black artists.

The exhibition “I made this….” The Work of Black American Artists and Artisans features roughly 30 pieces of art ranging from paintings and ceramics to quilts, furniture, and more.

Items on display in the Miodrag and Elizabeth Ridgely Blagojevich Gallery of the Dewitt Wallace Decorative Arts Museum were created by Black artists from the 18th to the 20th centuries. Alongside each piece are background details of the makers and what inspired them.

The individuals became artists for a variety of reasons, whether it was to make a living or express themselves, but, no matter the reason, “each makes a statement with their work,” said Jan Gilliam, manager of exhibition planning at Colonial Williamsburg.

“All of the people we are celebrating come from the Black community,” she said. “It’s fascinating to see not only the works of the different centuries and what has changed, but also how each of these individuals expressed themselves.”

Among the artists whose pieces are on view are David Drake, Bill Traylor, Thornton Dial,Sr., Cesar Chelor, Clementine Hunter, and William Edmondson. Drake, an enslaved potter from the 19th century, inspired the title of the exhibition, as the words “I made this” were among those he often wrote on his pots.

“It seemed very relevant to use it as a title,” said Gilliam.

The new art exhibit will be on display though December 31, 2025. As part of the celebration of the opening of “I made this….,” Colonial Williamsburg will also offer special programming including discussions with curators and educators over the next few weeks. These “Expert Talks” will be held on Tuesdays at 10:30am October 25, November 1, November 8, and November 15.

In addition, there will be “Works by Black Artists and Artisans” tours on Wednesdays at 3pm October 26, November 2, November 9, and November 16. Colonial Williamsburg is also planning a conference centered on the exhibition in November 2023.

140,ODU’s Barry Art Museum Presenting Mars Fest October 14-16,Peninsula Chronicle,https://peninsulachronicle.com/2022/10/11/odus-barry-art-museum-presenting-mars-fest-october-14-16/,Williamsburg,10/2022,"NORFOLK- The Barry Art Museum will illuminate Norfolk with Mars Fest, the second public arts festival held at Old Dominion University. Serving as a meeting point on 43rd Street, Luke Jerram’s large-scale sculpture, Mars, will illuminate the festival from 6pm to 10pm October 14 through October 16.

Every evening of the three-night festival, more than 60 campus and community partners will take over two blocks of 43rd Street and Monarch Way to showcase performances, talks, hands-on activities, demos, and more in celebration of Mars. In addition to its community partners, the event is presented by Old Dominion University as well as Joan P. Brock.

Jerram’s sculpture of the red planet hovers at nearly 23 feet in diameter, an approximate scale of 1:1 million. Each centimeter of the sculpture represents ten kilometers of the surface of Mars, and its galactic imagery is emphasized with lighting and customized surround-sound audio.

During performances and activities, attendees are welcome to shop the Martian Market by the Selden Market, experience glassblowing by the Chrysler Museum Glass Studio, visit Arts@ODU’s Supernova Stage for live music, and observe the celebrated planet through telescopes with Back Bay Amateur Astronomers. The Barry Art Museum will also be open to welcome visitors with hands-on activities from NASA Langley.

“We are thrilled to host this installation by world-renowned artist Luke Jerram,” said Charlotte Potter Kasic, executive director for the Barry Art Museum, in a press release. “The irresistible enchantment of the red planet has captured the imagination of astronomers, revolutionaries, mystics, engineers, writers, artists, and scientists alike. This artwork comes into orbit at a poignant time, when NASA is launching their Artemis mission and we look up in wonder at this desolate beauty.”

Known for his eye-catching public works of art, Jerram focuses on sculptures, installations, and live art projects. Residing in the United Kingdom and working internationally for 19 years, the artist has created projects that have excited and inspired people around the world.

The event is free and open to the public.

141,Jamestown Rediscovery Dedicates Book to Historic Interpreter,Peninsula Chronicle,https://peninsulachronicle.com/2022/09/29/jamestown-rediscovery-dedicates-book-to-historic-interpreter/,Williamsburg,09/2022,"Four hundred and three years ago, the first Africans were forcibly brought to Point Comfort, at the mouth of the James River, on the date recorded in the colonialist John Rolfe’s letters as “at the latter end of August” in 1619.

Taken from their homeland in Angola by Portuguese slave traders and subsequently captured by English privateers in the Gulf of Mexico, these 20 men and women were the first Africans in mainland English America, including one woman known to the historical record only as “Angela,” listed as living in the household of Captain William Pierce in Jamestown in 1625.

To recover the story of these enslaved people, Jamestown Rediscovery produced Angela: Jamestown and the First Africans, a book aimed at adding dimension to what has been learned through archaeology, history, and historical research. The book is written by a team of scholars, who chose to dedicate it to historic interpreter Valarie Gray-Holmes, whose portrayal of Angela brought her story to life for thousands of visitors to the national park site. 

“Her job was to give humanity to the historic outline we provided,” said Angel Johnston, communications manager at Historic Jamestowne. “Our visitors remember her programs. For a lot of them, it’s a hard topic, so it’s a really emotional memory.”

It’s hard for Gray-Holmes, too.

“Back in 2017, when first asked if I would be willing to develop an interpretation of this ‘person from the past,’ I was flattered, but then the reality set in,” Gray-Holmes wrote of her casting. “I was given a single name… Angela. No last name, paintings, or images. A name perhaps given to her as she reached the shores of Jamestown.”

Gray-Holmes struggled with the weighty responsibility of getting Angela’s story right but was buoyed by a visitor who told her, “Even if it is not Angela’s story that you tell, it is someone’s story.”

Johnston said Gray-Holmes was flattered by the dedication, graciously deflecting credit to the research she relied on.

“It really does take a village does it not?” Gray-Holmes said. “It started with a life to represent lives and all who honored our American story.

142,Linda Matney Gallery In Williamsburg Offers An Oasis For Contemporary Artists And Connoisseurs,Peninsula Chronicle,https://peninsulachronicle.com/2022/09/13/linda-matney-gallery-in-williamsburg-offers-an-oasis-for-contemporary-artists-and-connoisseurs/,Williamsburg,09/2022,"WILLIAMSBURG-A jaunt to Athens, GA at the age of 21 changed the course of John L. “Lee” Matney Jr.’s life forever. The Richmond native grew up in Newport News and graduated from Hampton Roads Academy before heading back to his birth city to attend college at the University of Richmond.

During his younger years, he was a self-described “shy guy” who began focusing on photography as a means of expression to balance an otherwise quiet world. While taking classes at the University of Richmond, he decided the college life wasn’t for him and moved to Athens, where he hoped to rub shoulders with other like-minded artists in the cultural hub.

“I wanted to move to a community with a bohemian kind of scene to work on my photography,” said Matney. “Even though I was really still quite shy, I was taking pictures of people and discovered the Hot Corner, which was where the B-52’s had their first practice space and where there was also this experimental art space that I met a lot of people at.”

Matney soon met the late Jeremy Ayers, a fellow artist, writer, and musician, who co-wrote songs for The B-52’s and R.E.M. Ayers was closely linked to Andy Warhol and was a superstar at The Factory. Ayers, along with others, encouraged Matney along the way.

“He was very influential, and someone who really encouraged me along the way with my art,” Matney said.

When Matney moved back to Virginia, he started working at an art gallery in Hilton Village in Newport News before opening his own space in Williamsburg. He founded the Linda Matney Gallery in 2010. The curator-driven art space is named after Matney’s mother, who passed away from breast cancer October 17, 2001.

The gallery specializes in developing thematic group exhibits and collaborative art projects with international and American artists. Matney also offers consulting for investment art. The gallery exhibits innovative and emerging artwork from both national and international artists that’s sold through https://www.artsy.net/partner/matney-gallery.

Matney recently finished packing up artwork that will be shown at the Pearl Fincher Museum of Fine Arts in Spring, TX, for the Three Excellences of Culture: Painting, Poetry and Music, the Work of Art Rosenbaum and Friends exhibit. The exhibit opens to the public on Saturday, September 24.

Unfortunately, Rosenbaum died of cancer on September 4 at the age of 83. Born in New York, he was a painter, musician, muralist, illustrator, and professor emeritus at the University of Georgia.

“While the show’s still going on, it’s a sad time,” said Matney. Matney said the goal of the show being held in Houston is to create a significant exhibit for Rosenbaum outside of his region.

“The exhibit’s really an encapsulation of the Athens scene associated with Art Rosenbaum and his students as well as some of the self-trained artists and musicians from the perspective of German expressionism and self-trained artforms, as well as musicology and the archiving of field recordings, and other documentation of culture,” he said.

Rosenbaum’s own paintings highlight images of Southern folklore upon richly colored canvases that depict lively figures who are often shown dancing or holding musical instruments. His paintings are in many collections across the country, including the New Orleans Museum of Art, the Georgia Museum of Art, and the Smithsonian National Museum of American Art.

Locally, the Linda Matney Gallery currently has a display entitled By a Thread, which features the work of two Christopher Newport University professors, Kristin Skees and Ryan Lytle. Through photography and sculpture, the duo investigates how the fabric of self-identity is woven from experiences, environments, and relationships, which is then shaped into an expression of how people impact the world.

Photographs by Skees explore identity and the uneasy relationship between the subject and artist, and artist and viewer. Lytle’s sculptures focus on memory, storytelling, and folklore as the underlying forces that contour the search for self-identity.

A costume party and closing reception for the By a Thread exhibit will be held from 6pm to 8:30pm on Friday, September 16. The event is free and open to the public.

Attendees are asked to dress up as their favorite artist or fashionista for a costume contest. Cash prizes include $200 for best costume, $100 for second place, and a $50 prize for honorable mention.

Laura Frazure’s Bodily Rhetoric will be on exhibit at the gallery beginning Saturday, October 8. Frazure is known for her distinctive approach to figurative sculpture, specifically concentrating on the female body. Rejecting direct observation and the use of live models, Frazure utilizes a more structural approach to form-making and invented proportional relations.

The Linda Matney Gallery is open from 11am to 5pm Thursday through Saturday and by appointment. It’s located at 5435 Richmond Road, Suite A, in Williamsburg.

143,,Peninsula Chronicle,https://peninsulachronicle.com/2022/05/09/the-ferguson-center-for-the-arts-names-atrium-after-former-newport-news-mayor-joe-frank-and-wife/,Williamsburg,05/2022,"NEWPORT NEWS—A crowd of Newport News residents, elected officials, friends, and family gathered on Friday, May 6 at the Ferguson Center for the Arts as the atrium was officially dedicated to long-serving Newport News Mayor Joe Frank and his late wife.

“All of us have been touched by the transforming influence of Joe and Jane Susan,” said Christopher Newport University President Paul Trible at the dedication ceremony.

“Many of us—family, friends, colleagues, business and community leaders—have faced moments of opportunity and moments of darkness, only to find Joe and Jane Susan standing with us. Their vision and leadership have been an unstoppable force for good. Now, this spectacular atrium lobby of the Alan and Beverly Diamonstein Concert Hall at the Ferguson Center has become the place where their lives and story will forever be celebrated and etched into the life of this community.”

The dedication was made possible by a $1 million gift to CNU from Frank’s childhood friend Mary Ann Elliott as a tribute to their friendship, and to recognize the numerous contributions Joe and Jane Susan made to the region. Elliott’s gift will help support the Community Captains Scholarship, a two-year preparatory program for students selected from all six Newport News high schools. It will be done through the Joe and Jane Susan Endowment Scholarship for Community Captains, which will carry on Joe and Jane Susan’s life work to empower the citizens of the community.

Elliott’s gift will also support the arts, with the creation of the Joe and Jane Susan Frank Endowment for the Arts. The endowment will bring outstanding performers and art exhibits to the Ferguson Center for the Arts and the Mary M. Torggler Fine Arts Center.

“There was a nice turnout, it was a wonderful event, and something that meant a great deal to me because it honored both my wife and myself,” said Frank. “My wife was just a very, very special lady who did wonderful things for this community. Honoring her in that way, with a scholarship and money for the arts—which was the primary purpose of the grant—was wonderful, special, and much appreciated.”

Although he doesn’t frequent the Ferguson Center as often now, he and his wife were previously faithful patrons.

“I love the place,” said Frank. “I was instrumental with Paul Trible in getting it off the ground, and getting the state and the city to put up money for it when I was mayor. It’s been a wonderful part of this community for many years now, and it has done a great deal to advance the cultural life of our community and region.”

Born and raised in Newport News, Joe Frank served many years on the Newport News City Council before becoming the first directly elected mayor in the city’s history in 1996. He was re-elected in 1998, 2002, and 2006.

Mary Ann Elliott is recognized as one of the nation’s top female satellite communications experts who founded Arrowhead Global Solutions, one of the fastest growing and most successful technology companies in the world.

“Maybe it was Joe’s humble beginnings that led him to always want to help those in need,” said Elliott in a press release. “He has led his life as an example for others to follow. It is truly a pleasure to provide funds for the Jane Susan and Joe Frank atrium in the Diamonstein Concert Hall.”","['newport', 'news—a', 'crowd', 'of', 'newport', 'news', 'residents', 'elected',

Lightwire Theatre will bring their distinctive technology of moving light characters to The American Theatre on Saturday, April 23 at 3pm in an adaptation of Aesop’s classic tale entitled, “The New Adventures of Tortoise and Hare: The Next Generation.”

The plotline of the show centers around the fabled tortoise and hare, ten years after their famous race. Now with children of their own, tortoise and hare explore modern day distractions, with smartphones and video games creating a new landscape of lost connections to life experiences. Tortoise and hare are now in a whole new kind of race in which their adventures lead them into unexpected territory.

According to a blurb released by The American Theatre, “People of all ages will be captivated by the dazzling visuals and the unique menagerie of characters that magically appear out of the darkness. With poignant storytelling and the creative use of music—from classical to pop—this production brings a classic tale into a new, brilliant light.”

Tickets are $35 for adults and $10 for children and can be purchased online.

2022 Hampton Jazz Festival Canceled Over Covid Concerns",Peninsula Chronicle,https://peninsulachronicle.com/2022/01/25/2022-hampton-jazz-festival-canceled-over-covid-concerns/,Williamsburg,01/2022,"HAMPTON—The Hampton Jazz Festival has been held annually on the last weekend of June since 1968. The halls of the Hampton Coliseum will be silent once again this year due to concerns about the pandemic and rapidly expanding omicron virus variant.

The festival has been a marquee event for the Hampton Coliseum, drawing crowds from all over the country. The premiere event in 1968 featured jazz legends such as Count Basie, Dizzy Gillespie, the Thelonious Monk Quartet, Dione Warwick, and Muddy Waters, to name a few.

Since then, the event has attracted a “Who’s Who” of jazz greats throughout the ages with performances from Ray Charles, Miles Davis, Herbie Hancock, Roberta Flack, B.B. King, Buddy Rich, Dave Brubeck, Duke Ellington, Stevie Wonder, Aretha Franklin, The Spinners, Teddy Pendergrass, Natalie Cole, Gladys Knight and the Pips, Chuck Mangione, Lou Rawls, Al Jarreau, George Benson, Ella Fitzgerald, Peabo Bryson, Spyro Gyra, George Jones, Etta James, Kool & The Gang, Peaches and Herb, Angela Bofill, Smokey Robinson, The O’Jays, Winton Marsalis, Bobby McFerrin, James Brown, Luther Vandross, Patti LaBelle, The Commodores, The Manhattans, Stevie Ray Vaughan, Anita Baker, The Four Tops, Be Be & Ce Ce Winans, Jeffrey Osbourne, Earl Klugh, Earth, Wind & Fire, Isaac Hayes, Chaka Khan, Robert Cray, Kenny G, The Ohio Players, Erykah Badu, Regina Belle, Stephanie Mills, Teena Marie, The Gap Band, Michael McDonald, Sheila E., En Vogue, Boyz to Men, David Sanborn, Jill Scott, Morris Day and the Time, Toni Braxton, Baby Face, Jennifer Hudson, New Edition, and Boney James—to name a few.

“The coronavirus has caused a variety of impacts and challenges over the past two years, including the current surge in the omicron variant,” said Terri Vander Vennet, director of the Hampton Coliseum. “Proceeding with an overabundance of caution in the face of uncertainty, the Hampton Jazz Festival Board of Directors decided it best to hold off this year.”

147,Frog to be placed in Garris Event Park,The Tidewater News,https://www.thetidewaternews.com/2022/08/27/frog-to-be-placed-in-garris-event-park/,Franklin,08/2022,"The Windsor Town Council voted 5-0 on Aug. 9 to accept the Windsor Economic Development Authority’s recommendation to place a town-owned frog sculpture in the Wesley F. Garris Event Park.

Featuring a Boy Scouts-themed paint design, this is one of three town-owned frog sculptures fabricated in hand lay up fiberglass by a company called Cowpainters. Each frog is 42 inches high, 42 inches wide, has 45 inches of depth and weighs about 250 pounds.

The sculptures are intended to be emblems for people to recognize the town by and are part of an initiative spearheaded by the Windsor EDA that draws upon the locality’s history of being a popular place for frogs due to the area’s heavy, wet soil.

Councilman Jake Redd, who is a member of the EDA, was not present at the council’s Aug. 9 meeting but asked Windsor Town Manager William Saunders to present the EDA’s recommendations in his stead.

Saunders also shared with council members some photos of the nearly completed Boy Scouts-themed frog sent to him by Redd.

“The EDA has proposed the placement of this frog to be at the Wesley Garris Event Park,” Saunders said. “The two remaining frogs, the farmer frog and the jewel-themed frog, the EDA recommends for the town center and the town property close to Shirley Drive.

“What (Redd) would like tonight is for the Town Council to take a vote on the location for the Boy Scout frog but not necessarily the other two,” Saunders added.

Councilwoman Kelly Blankenship said, “I’m fine with just going with the EDA’s recommendation.”

Other council members expressed agreement.

Mayor Glyn T. Willis asked if there were any more questions or comments before the council voted.

“I just think this looks awesome,” Councilman Walter Bernacki said, looking at the Boy Scouts frog in the photos.

“The Boy Scout frog looks pretty cool,” the mayor agreed.

Prior to Saunders’ brief presentation, Bernacki passed along some town marketing ideas related to the frogs that his daughter had shared with him.

The first idea involved the digital sign in front of Town Hall at 8 E. Windsor Blvd. Bernacki said his daughter asked if the sign was capable of doing simple animations, like a frog hopping across the screen. If so, she suggested the animation could occur with some level of frequency to get people driving by to wonder about it.

“Maybe it’ll encourage people to look up the town of Windsor,” Bernacki said.

His daughter’s second idea involved geocaching, which is described at adventure.howstuffworks.com as, at its most basic level, a “game where players use GPS receivers to track down a container or cache. Caches may contain any number of small items, or they may only contain a logbook for players to sign to mark their find.”

Bernacki said his daughter knows there is a big community out there that participates in geocaching, and her thought was that with these new frogs being publicly placed, perhaps a cache could be put near the frogs.

He suggested asking some of the businesses in town if they would be willing to place a special offer inside the cache, like Dairy Queen offering a free ice cream treat, for example.

“(Then we could) get a hold of a couple of these geocachers and say, ‘Hey, can you spread the word that this is the coordinates?’” Bernacki said. “And it can start spurring some interest to bring people into town, because they have quite the community that when someone finds a geocache, they always spread the word and everyone wants to come visit it, so hence, maybe a way to try to bring some people into town as well.”

The mayor encouraged Bernacki to pass these ideas along to Redd.","['the', 'windsor', 'town', 'council', 'voted', '5-0', 'on', 'aug', '9', 'to', 'accept', 'the', 'windsor', 'economic', 'development',

148,Southampton County supervisors approve new solar ordinance,The Tidewater News,https://www.thetidewaternews.com/2022/09/10/southampton-county-supervisors-approve-new-solar-ordinance/,Franklin,09/2022,"The Southampton County Board of Supervisors recently voted unanimously to approve a new solar ordinance that some have called the strictest in the state.

The new ordinance has been approved and in place since July 26, making clear to solar developers the rules and restrictions proposed projects must conform to. Community Development Director Beth Lewis will be able to receive project proposals after Saturday, Sept. 10, when the county’s 12-month moratorium on consideration of utility-scale solar energy projects ends.

Prior to the July 26 public hearing on the solar ordinance, Lewis shared what led up to the crafting of the ordinance and then outlined details of the ordinance itself.

“This evening is the required public hearing for the repeal of the current utility-scale solar regulations and its replacement with this proposed ordinance,” she said. “As you recall, on Sept. 9 of last year, the planning commission and the Board of Supervisors held a joint public hearing at which time a moratorium was adopted prohibiting the acceptance of applications for utility-scale solar projects.”

She noted that this moratorium was put in place to give the county time to craft a new ordinance to address what were seen as shortcomings in the existing ordinance. 

“The planning commission was charged with creating an ordinance that would mitigate the loss of valuable farm and forest land, look at impacts on the tax base and study decommissioning,” she said.

Lewis then provided a brief history of how solar regulation has developed recently in the county.

“A solar company first began speaking to the planning commission in the summer of 2015,” she said. “They submitted an application for a 100-megawatt project in June of 2016, and it was approved in September of 2016.

She stated that in June 2016, a second 100-megawatt project was proposed at 31118 Meherrin Road surrounding the substation, which was subsequently withdrawn after the planning commission public hearing.

In October of 2016, an application for a 90-megawatt, 700-acre utility-scale solar project was submitted to be located near the intersection of Smiths Ferry Road and Southampton Parkway, she said. That application was withdrawn in March 2017 prior to any public hearing.

“At the time of these applications, solar was relatively new in Virginia, and we had little in the way of example to go by in review of any of these projects,” she said. “The approved project, Southampton Solar, began construction in April of 2017 and was completed two years later.”

She noted that a project was proposed in the Ivor area in 2018. At least two community meetings were held on behalf of the property owners, and citizens spoke in opposition to that proposed project at a number of planning commission meetings prior to the submittal of any application. No application was ever submitted.

The existing solar ordinance that was in effect entering the Board of Supervisors’ July 26 meeting this year was adopted in December 2018, she said. An application that met the requirements of that ordinance was submitted in October 2019. It was subsequently denied by the Board of Supervisors in January 2020.

“The Board of Supervisors wanted something else,” she said. “The proposed ordinance seeks to address concerns that have been raised over the years.

“The minimum project size proposed is 20 megawatts and the maximum is 100 megawatts,” she continued. “The minimum is seen by the planning commission as limiting the smaller facilities that they see throughout northeastern North Carolina, some of which are not well taken care of.

“The proposed ordinance limits the land area of the county to be devoted to utility-scale solar to 1%, or 3,855 acres,” she said. “The existing Southampton Solar project uses 1,418 of those acres, leaving 2,437 acres available for further utility-scale solar development.”

Of that acreage under this proposed ordinance, 69% of the proposed area must be forested so as to retain the most productive agricultural land and agricultural production, Lewis noted. 

“And of course, any property in a voluntary agriculture and forestal district must be withdrawn from the program after two public hearings prior to the application,” she said.

She stated that while the retention of existing buffers is encouraged, any new buffers and screening must be planted in the first growing season after any land-disturbing permits are issued. This will permit the vegetation to begin to grow before construction is complete and the contractors leave.

“Non-native vegetation is limited and new vegetation must be certified nursery stock,” she said. “This will hopefully limit the intrusion of invasive plants and insects as were thought to have been brought in during the construction of Southampton Solar.”

The proposed ordinance also requires a bond of 100% of the landscape costs while the project is under construction and the retention of a $50,000 landscape bond for the life of the project so the county can repair or replace landscape buffering or cut tall grass if the operator does not, Lewis said.

She indicated that additional requirements of the new ordinance limit solar installations to at least 1 mile from incorporated places and 5 miles from another such project

“The 1-mile buffer around incorporated places seeks to limit the intrusion of such projects on the population centers of the county and to permit suburban-type development to continue in the areas around the towns so as to take advantage of the infrastructure that’s there and the amenities around those towns,” she said. “The 5-mile limit is to keep an area from being overwhelmed with solar development.”

There isn’t any utility-scale solar development in any of the abuting localities that would be within that 5-mile buffer today, she noted.

“Buffers and setbacks are increased to protect environmental, community and historical assets, and they can be expanded or contracted to meet the needs of the buffered areas,” she said

No topsoil can be removed, and grading of slopes greater than 15% is restricted, according to the new ordinance.

“This is seen as a way to perhaps return the property to agriculture and forestry use when the project is decommissioned, although the planning commission members and the agriculture and forestry community think it’s unlikely much of the land will ever be suitable for such redevelopment,” Lewis said.

Continuing, she stated that the required community meetings must be held no more than 6 months prior to the submittal of a complete application so as to permit current property owners to be aware instead of those who may have sold property years ago. And all documents must be recorded with the clerk of the court so they can be searchable by anyone.

“But the most difficult part of this ordinance review was the decommissioning phase,” she said. “No project of this type has been decommissioned in the United States. 

“The planning commission had strong wishes not to inflict decommissioning on their children and grandchildren,” she continued. “One way to do that is to require surety of 100% of the decommissioning cost to be provided with no credit for salvage value. This has been part of the planning commission’s recommendation since the existing ordinance was adopted back in 2019.”

She noted that if the decommissioned materials have value, the decommissioning entity gets that reward. If that material has little or no value, the taxpayers of the county are not left with the bill.

Lewis concluded by highlighting how the Southampton County Planning Commission’s eight attending members at its June 9 meeting made a unanimous recommendation to the Board of Supervisors to approve the new solar ordinance.

During the July 26 public hearing, three members of the public spoke in favor of approving the proposed ordinance. Two individuals, speaking on behalf of solar developers, encouraged loosening some of the ordinance’s restrictions, and one individual encouraged the board to rely on a conditional use permit process instead of restrictive ordinance language, noting that the CUP process will allow the board to tailor projects to the county’s desire.

Encouraging the CUP process was Blake Cox, of Chesterfield, who is formerly of Conservatives for Clean Energy and said that he is “making sure there’s a common sense voice at the local level when we have these energy discussions.”

“Many Southampton County landowners want to use their land for solar projects,” he said. “They believe as Americans they should be able to do so as long as the rights of others are not violated. They want to use their own property to generate income for their families, income that benefits not only themselves but the businesses and citizens of Southampton as well.

“Aspects of the ordinance, like the megawatt and acreage restrictions, would be detrimental to landowners and the state of solar in Southampton County,” he continued. “Not only does limiting the megawattage and acreage restrict the rights of landowners but also ties the hands of this board and the supervisors who will follow you.”


Alan W. Edwards

During supervisor comments prior to the board’s vote, Jerusalem District Supervisor and Board Chair Alan W. Edwards said, “I agree with some of the people tonight — I’d just as soon have zero solar. I think it’s one of the biggest sales jobs that we’ve had. It’s inefficient to make a solar farm. The carbon footprint that you take to make it and maintain it is much higher than you’ll ever save in 30 years.

“Europe right now has got themselves in trouble with windmills and solar power,” he continued. “They’re going to small and medium nuclear.”

He noted that he has researched the issue and talked to engineers from energy companies.

“From Duke Energy, I talked to an engineer that told me, ‘If the public knew what was going on with this, they would never stand for it,’” Edwards said. “So I think our ordinance is as strict as it gets. I’ve been told it’s the strictest one in the state. I’ve already had two counties contact me about copies — Rockingham County and Greene County. … I’m rather proud of it, so that’s all I have to say at this point.”


Lynda T. Updike

Capron District Supervisor and Board Vice Chair William Hart Gillette also expressed his support for the new ordinance.

Newsoms District Supervisor Lynda T. Updike said, “I’d like to make a motion that we accept the new ordinance, and I’d like to do it in Glenn’s memory. I wish he was here to see it.”

Her late husband and former supervisor Glenn Updike had put a lot of work into helping maintain the county’s way of life in the face of solar developments, as Edwards noted moments later.

The ordinance was approved as written entering the meeting.","['the', 'southampton', 'county', 'board', 'of', 'supervisors', 'recently', 'voted', 'unanimously', 'to', 'approve', 'a', 'new', 'solar',

'vice']",9.0,2022.0,"the southampton county board of supervisors recently voted unanimously to approve a new solar ordinance that some have called the strictest in the state 

the new ordinance has been approved and in place since july 26  making clear to solar developers the rules and restrictions proposed projects must conform to  community development director beth lewis will be able to receive project proposals after saturday  sept  10  when the county’s 12-month moratorium on consideration of utility-scale solar energy projects ends 

prior to the july 26 public hearing on the solar ordinance  lewis shared what led up to the crafting of the ordinance and then outlined details of the ordinance itself 

“this evening is the required public hearing for the repeal of the current utility-scale solar regulations and its replacement with this proposed ordinance ” she said  “as you recall  on sept  9 of last year  the planning commission and the board of supervisors held a joint public hearing at which time a moratorium was adopted prohibiting the acceptance of applications for utility-scale solar projects ”

she noted that this moratorium was put in place to give the county time to craft a new ordinance to address what were seen as shortcomings in the existing ordinance  

“the planning commission was charged with creating an ordinance that would mitigate the loss of valuable farm and forest land  look at impacts on the tax base and study decommissioning ” she said 

lewis then provided a brief history of how solar regulation has developed recently in the county 

“a solar company first began speaking to the planning commission in the summer of 2015 ” she said  “they submitted an application for a 100-megawatt project in june of 2016  and it was approved in september of 2016 

she stated that in june 2016  a second 100-megawatt project was proposed at 31118 meherrin road surrounding the substation  which was subsequently withdrawn after the planning commission public hearing 

in october of 2016  an application for a 90-megawatt  700-acre utility-scale solar project was submitted to be located near the intersection of smiths ferry road and southampton parkway  she said  that application was withdrawn in march 2017 prior to any public hearing 

“at the time of these applications  solar was relatively new in virginia  and we had little in the way of example to go by in review of any of these projects ” she said  “the approved project  southampton solar  began construction in april of 2017 and was completed two years later ”

she noted that a project was proposed in the ivor area in 2018  at least two community meetings were held on behalf of the property owners  and citizens spoke in opposition to that proposed project at a number of planning commission meetings prior to the submittal of any application  no application was ever submitted 

the existing solar ordinance that was in effect entering the board of supervisors’ july 26 meeting this year was adopted in december 2018  she said  an application that met the requirements of that ordinance was submitted in october 2019  it was subsequently denied by the board of supervisors in january 2020 

“the board of supervisors wanted something else ” she said  “the proposed ordinance seeks to address concerns that have been raised over the years 

“the minimum project size proposed is 20 megawatts and the maximum is 100 megawatts ” she continued  “the minimum is seen by the planning commission as limiting the smaller facilities that they see throughout northeastern north carolina  some of which are not well taken care of 

“the proposed ordinance limits the land area of the county to be devoted to utility-scale solar to 1%  or 3 855 acres ” she said  “the existing southampton solar project uses 1 418 of those acres  leaving 2 437 acres available for further utility-scale solar development ”

of that acreage under this proposed ordinance  69% of the proposed area must be forested so as to retain the most productive agricultural land and agricultural production  lewis noted  

“and of course  any property in a voluntary agriculture and forestal district must be withdrawn from the program after two public hearings prior to the application ” she said 

she stated that while the retention of existing buffers is encouraged  any new buffers and screening must be planted in the first growing season after any land-disturbing permits are issued  this will permit the vegetation to begin to grow before construction is complete and the contractors leave 

“non-native vegetation is limited and new vegetation must be certified nursery stock ” she said  “this will hopefully limit the intrusion of invasive plants and insects as were thought to have been brought in during the construction of southampton solar ”

the proposed ordinance also requires a bond of 100% of the landscape costs while the project is under construction and the retention of a $50 000 landscape bond for the life of the project so the county can repair or replace landscape buffering or cut tall grass if the operator does not  lewis said 

she indicated that additional requirements of the new ordinance limit solar installations to at least 1 mile from incorporated places and 5 miles from another such project

“the 1-mile buffer around incorporated places seeks to limit the intrusion of such projects on the population centers of the county and to permit suburban-type development to continue in the areas around the towns so as to take advantage of the infrastructure that’s there and the amenities around those towns ” she said  “the 5-mile limit is to keep an area from being overwhelmed with solar development ”

there isn’t any utility-scale solar development in any of the abuting localities that would be within that 5-mile buffer today  she noted 

“buffers and setbacks are increased to protect environmental  community and historical assets  and they can be expanded or contracted to meet the needs of the buffered areas ” she said

no topsoil can be removed  and grading of slopes greater than 15% is restricted  according to the new ordinance 

“this is seen as a way to perhaps return the property to agriculture and forestry use when the project is decommissioned  although the planning commission members and the agriculture and forestry community think it’s unlikely much of the land will ever be suitable for such redevelopment ” lewis said 

continuing  she stated that the required community meetings must be held no more than 6 months prior to the submittal of a complete application so as to permit current property owners to be aware instead of those who may have sold property years ago  and all documents must be recorded with the clerk of the court so they can be searchable by anyone 

“but the most difficult part of this ordinance review was the decommissioning phase ” she said  “no project of this type has been decommissioned in the united states  

“the planning commission had strong wishes not to inflict decommissioning on their children and grandchildren ” she continued  “one way to do that is to require surety of 100% of the decommissioning cost to be provided with no credit for salvage value  this has been part of the planning commission’s recommendation since the existing ordinance was adopted back in 2019 ”

she noted that if the decommissioned materials have value  the decommissioning entity gets that reward  if that material has little or no value  the taxpayers of the county are not left with the bill 

lewis concluded by highlighting how the southampton county planning commission’s eight attending members at its june 9 meeting made a unanimous recommendation to the board of supervisors to approve the new solar ordinance 

during the july 26 public hearing  three members of the public spoke in favor of approving the proposed ordinance  two individuals  speaking on behalf of solar developers  encouraged loosening some of the ordinance’s restrictions  and one individual encouraged the board to rely on a conditional use permit process instead of restrictive ordinance language  noting that the cup process will allow the board to tailor projects to the county’s desire 

encouraging the cup process was blake cox  of chesterfield  who is formerly of conservatives for clean energy and said that he is “making sure there’s a common sense voice at the local level when we have these energy discussions ”

“many southampton county landowners want to use their land for solar projects ” he said  “they believe as americans they should be able to do so as long as the rights of others are not violated  they want to use their own property to generate income for their families  income that benefits not only themselves but the businesses and citizens of southampton as well 

“aspects of the ordinance  like the megawatt and acreage restrictions  would be detrimental to landowners and the state of solar in southampton county ” he continued  “not only does limiting the megawattage and acreage restrict the rights of landowners but also ties the hands of this board and the supervisors who will follow you ”


alan w  edwards

during supervisor comments prior to the board’s vote  jerusalem district supervisor and board chair alan w  edwards said  “i agree with some of the people tonight — i’d just as soon have zero solar  i think it’s one of the biggest sales jobs that we’ve had  it’s inefficient to make a solar farm  the carbon footprint that you take to make it and maintain it is much higher than you’ll ever save in 30 years 

“europe right now has got themselves in trouble with windmills and solar power ” he continued  “they’re going to small and medium nuclear ”

he noted that he has researched the issue and talked to engineers from energy companies 

“from duke energy  i talked to an engineer that told me  ‘if the public knew what was going on with this  they would never stand for it ’” edwards said  “so i think our ordinance is as strict as it gets  i’ve been told it’s the strictest one in the state  i’ve already had two counties contact me about copies — rockingham county and greene county  … i’m rather proud of it  so that’s all i have to say at this point ”


lynda t  updike

capron district supervisor and board vice chair william hart gillette also expressed his support for the new ordinance 

newsoms district supervisor lynda t  updike said  “i’d like to make a motion that we accept the new ordinance  and i’d like to do it in glenn’s memory  i wish he was here to see it ”

her late husband and former supervisor glenn updike had put a lot of work into helping maintain the county’s way of life in the face of solar developments  as edwards noted moments later

149,Sumblin translates authenticity into music,The Tidewater News,https://www.thetidewaternews.com/2022/08/26/sumblin-translates-authenticity-into-music/,Franklin,08/2022,"Tevin Sumblin, who was born and raised in Franklin, is a successful architectural engineer in Atlanta who has been making the most of many different talents he has been given. This is why he has also developed into a popular rapper who is releasing his debut album Friday, Aug. 26.

Music has been a passion for the 27-year-old Sumblin since he was in middle school, but he was not expecting to become a professional performer and recording artist.

“It’s not something I had planned for my life, but I feel that God has pushed me in that direction,” he said.

He noted that his “true passion for music came around the age of 12 or 13 years old just listening to lyrical artists such as Biggie, Tupac, Jay-Z, even Lil Wayne at the time, just appreciating what they were saying in some of the music that was influential,” he said. “I know some of the messages aren’t the greatest, but as far as certain songs, I always try to attract myself to something positive. Later on down the road, it became a love for even some gospel artists like Andy Mineo, Lecrae.”

He said his passion has continually evolved, and his brother, Ryan Sumblin, introduced him to one of his favorite artists today, Wale.

For Tevin, music started as a hobby.

“I’ve always wanted to write music,” he said. “I probably started writing when I was around 14 years old, but I never released anything.”

He would write something and then throw it in the trash because he didn’t think it was good.

Sumblin graduated from Franklin High School in 2013 and then went to college at North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University to pursue his degree in architectural engineering. But he also continued to write music.

“So I was in college my sophomore year, and my friend told me, he was like, ‘Hey, man, I saw what you wrote. You should actually perform it and put it out there,’” Sumblin recalled. “So I did it my sophomore year, got great reception, and ever since then (writing’s) just become a passion for me. I just love to write about my life and my story, about God, about my family and just keep it real.”

A notable quality of Sumblin’s music is that he does not curse in any of his songs, which is a conscious decision.

“I want my music to be for everyone,” he said. “My music, it tells the story about the pains and the ups and the downs through my life, how God has blessed me from the little small-town kid to be where I am today, so I wanted to make sure that’s reflected in my music about who I am.”

After he graduated magna cum laude from North Carolina A&T, Sumblin’s move to Atlanta was motivated by his full-time engineering work, though it is more and more serving a dual purpose.

“I always say that I don’t believe in luck, I believe that God predestined everything,” he said. “With Atlanta being a big music space, it was only right for God to place me here for my job.”

Turner Construction Company had opportunities in Charlotte, North Carolina, and Atlanta, Georgia.

“Since a little kid, I always said I wanted to live in Atlanta,” Sumblin said, “I just don’t know why I said that as a kid,” but he made it a reality when he chose the Atlanta opportunity. “Me and my wife are just down here thriving now. I just thank God for his blessings.”

His music career began to develop in Atlanta when he started doing a lot of showcases around the city, meeting people.

“And even when I joined Kappa Alpha Psi Fraternity Inc. down in Atlanta, it opened a lot of doors for me to meet some people as well within the music industry and just helped me expand,” he said.

Sumblin’s music is released to all the major streaming platforms through an independent company called UnitedMasters.

He noted that UnitedMasters has opportunities on its website offering people chances to submit music and have it be showcased in major ways.

He wrote a song called “The Come Up” and released it in 2020.

“When I wrote this song, I was like, ‘I think this would be a cool video game song, especially for basketball,’” he said. “I’ve always been a huge basketball fan, as well as baseball, since I was a little kid, and I submitted my song.”

As time passed, he forgot about having submitted it, and he said it was probably five months later, in February of 2021, that he heard it had been selected as a finalist for being showcased in a video game.

A week after he was told it was a finalist, he awoke from a nap to an epic phone call.

“I woke up to Steve Stoute, who is the CEO of UnitedMasters, and Jayson Tatum, NBA all-star from the Boston Celtics, listening to my song,” he said. “They were bobbing their heads, they were having a great time listening to it, and they were like, ‘Hey, man, you’ve been selected as a featured artist on the NBA 2K22 soundtrack.’”

NBA 2K is a highly popular video game series that has been running for more than 20 years and regularly features famous and developing artists on its soundtracks.

“So that was big for me, and it’s almost like a dream come true,” Sumblin said. “It’s not something I had planned for my life, but I feel that God has pushed me in that direction.”

He said that one thing he laughs with joy and smiles about with his wife is that he has had a variety of artists that he has looked up to and admired for years, and “now I’m on the same soundtrack with these people, so it’s a great feeling. It’s truly a pleasure and an honor.”

He noted that he was one of only 10 people from across the globe whose music was selected from a field of more than 13,000 submissions.

“From there on, I saw that the world was actually appreciative of the gift that God gave me, so I took it seriously, sat down and really focused in and honed in on this album.”

The 11-track album that he has been working on for about a year is titled “WordPlay.”

Sumblin indicated that this album would not have been possible to write when he was much younger.

“One thing I know I realized is I had to go through life to really talk about something,” he said.

And that is what the album does — it talks about his life. It talks about his family, and the family he and his wife, Chardonnay Sumblin, hope to build.

“One thing I like to offer is transparency, so my testimony is, me and my wife, we’ve actually experienced four miscarriages,” he said. “That’s in the album as well, and that’s the reason I do what I do is because I understand there’s other people in the world who’ve experienced what I’ve experienced, and sometimes they feel alone, so I’m hoping to reach a lot of people who’ve maybe experienced what I’ve experienced.”

Deante Hitchcock, a platinum artist, will feature on “WordPlay.”

Tevin said the album features really fast, lyrical rapping, as well as smooth, suave rapping that he knows a lot of women will enjoy, especially his wife. 

“Most of my music, when it’s female-related, is literally about her, just the things we’ve been through, my mindset of thinking of her,” he said. “It just makes life and music easy. I feel like when you’re authentic and not superficial, it just becomes easy. You just rap about what you go through in your life.”

As a rapper, Sumblin goes by the name E.R.A.

“It is an acronym, and it stands for ‘Every Rhyme’s Authentic,’” he said. 

It fits as a description of the music he is creating, and a couple other factors went into making it his rap name as well.

“The reason I gave myself that rap name a little while ago was I realized that in most of the videos I was shooting, I was wearing a New Era cap, and I’ve always been a baseball fan and a baseball player,” said Sumblin, who was a three-time MVP for Franklin High School’s baseball program. “So I was like, ‘Hey, this is a good way to mix baseball, my love for hats and everything into one,’ and then it just created itself into Every Rhyme’s Authentic, so I’ve stuck with it since — for about six years now.”

Sumblin’s music has more than 20,000 monthly listeners on Spotify, and he has more than 500,000 streams as an artist.

He has now lived in Atlanta for a little more than five years. Engineering remains his full-time work, but music has begun to bring in some money as well.

“I’m a very busy person,” he said. “A lot of times I just love to have my hands in different things, so I continue to push forward in engineering, investments, all kinds of different things, and then music, of course, is one of my top priorities.”

And he and Chardonnay have maintained their focus on building a family.

“We’re still praying, still hoping, we’re excited for the kids God’s going to bless us with in the future, so that’s where we are now,” he said.

Until then, they have blessings they are spending their time counting now, with his debut album being the latest.

“We’ve definitely experienced a lot of blessings coming from a small town, and being able to make something of ourselves out here in Atlanta now, it’s definitely a blessing from above,” he said.

“WordPlay” will be available on all major streaming platforms.

has been given  this is why he has also developed into a popular rapper who is releasing his debut album friday  aug  26 

music has been a passion for the 27-year-old sumblin since he was in middle school  but he was not expecting to become a professional performer and recording artist 

“it’s not something i had planned for my life  but i feel that god has pushed me in that direction ” he said 

he noted that his “true passion for music came around the age of 12 or 13 years old just listening to lyrical artists such as biggie  tupac  jay-z  even lil wayne at the time  just appreciating what they were saying in some of the music that was influential ” he said  “i know some of the messages aren’t the greatest  but as far as certain songs  i always try to attract myself to something positive  later on down the road  it became a love for even some gospel artists like andy mineo  lecrae ”

he said his passion has continually evolved  and his brother  ryan sumblin  introduced him to one of his favorite artists today  wale 

for tevin  music started as a hobby 

“i’ve always wanted to write music ” he said  “i probably started writing when i was around 14 years old  but i never released anything ”

he would write something and then throw it in the trash because he didn’t think it was good 

sumblin graduated from franklin high school in 2013 and then went to college at north carolina agricultural and technical state university to pursue his degree in architectural engineering  but he also continued to write music 

“so i was in college my sophomore year  and my friend told me  he was like  ‘hey  man  i saw what you wrote  you should actually perform it and put it out there ’” sumblin recalled  “so i did it my sophomore year  got great reception  and ever since then (writing’s) just become a passion for me  i just love to write about my life and my story  about god  about my family and just keep it real ”

a notable quality of sumblin’s music is that he does not curse in any of his songs  which is a conscious decision 

“i want my music to be for everyone ” he said  “my music  it tells the story about the pains and the ups and the downs through my life  how god has blessed me from the little small-town kid to be where i am today  so i wanted to make sure that’s reflected in my music about who i am ”

after he graduated magna cum laude from north carolina a&t  sumblin’s move to atlanta was motivated by his full-time engineering work  though it is more and more serving a dual purpose 

“i always say that i don’t believe in luck  i believe that god predestined everything ” he said  “with atlanta being a big music space  it was only right for god to place me here for my job ”

turner construction company had opportunities in charlotte  north carolina  and atlanta  georgia 

“since a little kid  i always said i wanted to live in atlanta ” sumblin said  “i just don’t know why i said that as a kid ” but he made it a reality when he chose the atlanta opportunity  “me and my wife are just down here thriving now  i just thank god for his blessings ”

his music career began to develop in atlanta when he started doing a lot of showcases around the city  meeting people 

“and even when i joined kappa alpha psi fraternity inc  down in atlanta  it opened a lot of doors for me to meet some people as well within the music industry and just helped me expand ” he said 

sumblin’s music is released to all the major streaming platforms through an independent company called unitedmasters 

he noted that unitedmasters has opportunities on its website offering people chances to submit music and have it be showcased in major ways 

he wrote a song called “the come up” and released it in 2020 

“when i wrote this song  i was like  ‘i think this would be a cool video game song  especially for basketball ’” he said  “i’ve always been a huge basketball fan  as well as baseball  since i was a little kid  and i submitted my song ”

as time passed  he forgot about having submitted it  and he said it was probably five months later  in february of 2021  that he heard it had been selected as a finalist for being showcased in a video game 

a week after he was told it was a finalist  he awoke from a nap to an epic phone call 

“i woke up to steve stoute  who is the ceo of unitedmasters  and jayson tatum  nba all-star from the boston celtics  listening to my song ” he said  “they were bobbing their heads  they were having a great time listening to it  and they were like  ‘hey  man  you’ve been selected as a featured artist on the nba 2k22 soundtrack ’”

nba 2k is a highly popular video game series that has been running for more than 20 years and regularly features famous and developing artists on its soundtracks 

“so that was big for me  and it’s almost like a dream come true ” sumblin said  “it’s not something i had planned for my life  but i feel that god has pushed me in that direction ”

he said that one thing he laughs with joy and smiles about with his wife is that he has had a variety of artists that he has looked up to and admired for years  and “now i’m on the same soundtrack with these people  so it’s a great feeling  it’s truly a pleasure and an honor ”

he noted that he was one of only 10 people from across the globe whose music was selected from a field of more than 13 000 submissions 

“from there on  i saw that the world was actually appreciative of the gift that god gave me  so i took it seriously  sat down and really focused in and honed in on this album ”

the 11-track album that he has been working on for about a year is titled “wordplay ”

sumblin indicated that this album would not have been possible to write when he was much younger 

“one thing i know i realized is i had to go through life to really talk about something ” he said 

and that is what the album does — it talks about his life  it talks about his family  and the family he and his wife  chardonnay sumblin  hope to build 

“one thing i like to offer is transparency  so my testimony is  me and my wife  we’ve actually experienced four miscarriages ” he said  “that’s in the album as well  and that’s the reason i do what i do is because i understand there’s other people in the world who’ve experienced what i’ve experienced  and sometimes they feel alone  so i’m hoping to reach a lot of people who’ve maybe experienced what i’ve experienced ”

deante hitchcock  a platinum artist  will feature on “wordplay ”

tevin said the album features really fast  lyrical rapping  as well as smooth  suave rapping that he knows a lot of women will enjoy  especially his wife  

“most of my music  when it’s female-related  is literally about her  just the things we’ve been through  my mindset of thinking of her ” he said  “it just makes life and music easy  i feel like when you’re authentic and not superficial  it just becomes easy  you just rap about what you go through in your life ”

as a rapper  sumblin goes by the name e r a 

“it is an acronym  and it stands for ‘every rhyme’s authentic ’” he said  

it fits as a description of the music he is creating  and a couple other factors went into making it his rap name as well 

“the reason i gave myself that rap name a little while ago was i realized that in most of the videos i was shooting  i was wearing a new era cap  and i’ve always been a baseball fan and a baseball player ” said sumblin  who was a three-time mvp for franklin high school’s baseball program  “so i was like  ‘hey  this is a good way to mix baseball  my love for hats and everything into one ’ and then it just created itself into every rhyme’s authentic  so i’ve stuck with it since — for about six years now ”

sumblin’s music has more than 20 000 monthly listeners on spotify  and he has more than 500 000 streams as an artist 

he has now lived in atlanta for a little more than five years  engineering remains his full-time work  but music has begun to bring in some money as well 

“i’m a very busy person ” he said  “a lot of times i just love to have my hands in different things  so i continue to push forward in engineering  investments  all kinds of different things  and then music  of course  is one of my top priorities ”

and he and chardonnay have maintained their focus on building a family 

“we’re still praying  still hoping  we’re excited for the kids god’s going to bless us with in the future  so that’s where we are now ” he said 

until then  they have blessings they are spending their time counting now  with his debut album being the latest 

“we’ve definitely experienced a lot of blessings coming from a small town  and being able to make something of ourselves out here in atlanta now  it’s definitely a blessing from above ” he said 

“wordplay” will be available on all major streaming platforms

150,Riverfront Soul Festival becomes 3-day event,The Tidewater News,https://www.thetidewaternews.com/2022/07/29/riverfront-soul-festival-becomes-3-day-event/,Franklin,07/2022,"The second annual Riverfront Soul Festival is coming in September with a notable difference from its debut in 2021 — it’s expanding from one day to three.

“This year’s even bigger,” Festival Founder Dr. Eric Majette said.

The free event will unfold in the city of Franklin from Sept. 9-11.

It will bring back some of the key things that made it a success last year, including live jazz, gospel and Christian rap music at Barrett’s Landing Park, along with a comedy show. There will be vendors and food available too.

This year, however, the festival will get started Friday, Sept. 9, with a Community Health and Wellness Fair at Camp Community College’s Workforce Development Center.

“We’re going to address the health problems affecting the families in the city of Franklin and surrounding region,” Majette said. “It’s basically an education event.”

He noted that medical professionals and field experts will be collaborating together to educate the community on the importance of health screenings and preventive health.

“We’re looking at giving away free COVID testing kits, high blood pressure checks, diabetes, heart health and cancer and breast and prostate,” Majette said.

He also noted that other topics that will be addressed at the fair include sickle cell disease, stress management and healthy eating.

The fair will run from 1-7 p.m. on Sept. 9.

On Saturday, Sept. 10, the festival shifts to Barrett’s Landing Park, where people can enjoy live music and comedy from 1-7 p.m.

“And then Sunday morning, I’m doing an all-inclusive collaboration worship service, and then Sunday afternoon, that’s when the Christian artists will come out, and they will perform,” Majette said. “We’re going to have a showcase, and we’re going to be giving away $500.”

The Sunday, Sept. 11, events will all take place at Barrett’s Landing Park and run from 11 a.m. until around 6 p.m.

Majette said some major corporations have reached out to him in connection to the festival, including Optima, AT&T and Bon Secours, and he said the city of Franklin will be one of the big promoters of the event this year.

He noted that more than a thousand people attended the festival throughout the day in 2021, and he gave his thoughts on what made the growth to a three-day event possible.

“It was just that I think last year, the word got out after the festival — everybody had such a great time,” he said. “We had absolutely no incidents at all. The community started talking about it, and then we had a lot of out-of-towners, too, that came, not just Franklin. We had people as far as Baltimore and Richmond that came out and talked about how much of a great time they had at the festival. And then also, I think all the acts were good. The vendors were strong. All the vendors made money.”

Coming out of the COVID-19 pandemic, people needed an outlet, he said.

This year, he noted that the festival also has the opportunity to leave an important impact in the community as it relates to health and wellness.

Majette stated that sponsorships and vending opportunities are available.

“We would like to invite corporate and community organizations to partner with us as we increase our positive impact,” festival officials stated.

151,29th Green Corn Powwow draws guests from across U.S.,The Tidewater News,https://www.thetidewaternews.com/2022/07/30/29th-green-corn-powwow-draws-guests-from-across-u-s/,Franklin,07/2022,"The Cheroenhaka (Nottoway) Indian Tribe of Southampton County hosted its 29th Green Corn Powwow at Cattashowrock Town July 2 in Courtland as a celebration of 442 years of documented ethnohistory of the tribe’s culture and traditions.

A tribe news release noted that at the event, the Powwow Circle was a maze of color, with some 70 native dancers in full native regalia gracing it for the grand entry to the sound of the host drum, Yapatoko. 

Rickie “Two Beavers” Boone, the powwow chairman, said the event averaged some 700 to 800 visitors gathering from across the East and West coasts, which made the arts and craft vendors very happy. 

Tribe officials noted that everyone loved the Indian taco, funnel cake, fry bread, Buffalo Burgers, corn on the cob and fish diners.

“By 4 p.m. we were sold out of native food,” officials stated.

Cheroenhaka (Nottoway) Indian Tribe Chief Walt “Red Hawk” Brown stated that he was very appreciative of all the native dancers who attended the Green Corn Powwow and looks forward to their return Nov. 4-6 for the Corn Harvest Intertribal Powwow and School Day. 

Special recognition was given to all tribal members, honorary tribal members and to the board of directors of the Cheroenhaka (Nottoway) Indian Tribe Heritage Foundation, whose support “made the powwow a stunning success,” officials stated. They also gave accolades to the Archaeological Society of Virginia, Nansemond Chapter, for its 16 years of continuing support to the tribe’s powwows, and further accolades went to the general populace for all of its support.

“We are very thankful that Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin sent a letter of congratulations to the tribe on its 29th Green Corn Powwow,” tribe officials said.

159,Student artists focus on sustainable water,Suffolk News-Herald,https://www.suffolknewsherald.com/2022/02/11/student-artists-focus-on-sustainable-water/,Suffolk,02/2022,"Rory Rockwood said she wanted her artwork, “Every Last Drop,” to represent the loss of all resources and wasting them. Her Nansemond-Suffolk Academy classmate, Kennedy Dryden, wanted her poem, “Shore Invasion” to denote shorelines becoming shorter due to global warming and sea level rise because of melting glaciers.

The two seniors excelled at what they produced and earned best-in-show-honors, Rockwood taking the art award and Dryden the literary award, at the Sister Cities International’s 33rd annual Young Artists and Authors Showcase, held after a year’s absence with the theme, Generation Rescue: Sustainable Water for All.

Bruce Spiro, president of Suffolk Sister Cities, praised the roughly 150 students who created artwork for the show, saying it was wonderful to have the event again after a year’s absence due to COVID-19.

“To have a theme that’s established on the national level and everyone on a local basis puts their heart and imagination into it, we’ve had some great representation at the national level,” Spiro said.

Dryden said her poem came to her quickly — it took her about 10 minutes to write. She learned she could do it for extra credit, and then after that she looked to make the poem rhyme, so she rhymed every two lines. She said it flowed easily, crediting her NSA English teacher, Kelly Jenkins, and her parents for having her go to the school.

“I go to the beach a lot, and I pick up the trash, and I’ve noticed a lot of animals and I’ve seen some dead sea life,” Dryden said, “because I also know a lot of people that live there, that are being forced to move out due to flooding and I just wanted to highlight the fact that no matter what we do, unless we all decide to work together, we can’t reverse the issue, and it’s not just in the Outer Banks, it’s all over the world.”

For Rockwood, she originally visualized Earth as something drastically different.

“I wanted to visualize taking every last bit we can from Earth,” Rockwood said, “and originally, the Earth was actually a hot dog, and I put Earth instead of a hot dog.”

Spiro said this was the right time for the event to return.

“We just had to respond to the times,” Spiro said. “And this was the right time for this, and the kids were excited about it.”

The committee assistant chairwoman for the Young Artists and Authors, MaryAnne Persons, said the judges were impressed about the talent on display at the city’s schools.

“It’s why some categories have so many honorable mentions,” Persons said, “that they realize the work that goes in because of their backgrounds, but also recognize what great talent we have.”

Norfolk State University fine arts professor Solomon Isekeije, the show’s juror, selected 116 artworks for the exhibit. This year, 104 students entered 186 artworks to be juried.

It awarded Marley McClusker of Nansemond River and the Governor’s School best in show honors for her mixed media works, “Gaia” and “Blossom.” Syd Osborne of King’s Fork and the Governor’s School earned first place for his screen prints, “Phobia Inception” and “Burning Touch.” Second place went to Emma Conrod of Nansemond-Suffolk Academy for her Ebony pencil and watercolor “Heart Ache,” while third place went to NSA student Matt Nichols for his clay and underglaze artwork, “The Smelly Snail.”

According to a news release issued by U.S. Sens. Mark Warner and Tim Kaine, the city will receive $565,000 to purchase new electric buses and charging statiions.

The funding was awarded through the Department of Transportation’s Fiscal Year 2022 Low or Now Emission Vehicle Program that helps state and local governments purchase or lease zero-emission and low-emission transit buses as well as acquire and construct support facilities, and was made possible by the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act negotiated by Sen. Warner and supported by Sen. Kaine, according to the release.

“Electric and natural gas vehicles offer a clean and affordable alternative to traditional fuel vehicles,” the senators said. “We are glad to see Virginia receive this funding to support the adoption of more energy efficient vehicles and the needed infrastructure to continue our transition to a transportation system with a significantly lower impact on the environment.”

The Greater Richmond Transit Co. is receiving the remainder of the money. More than $10 million will go to replace natural gas buses that have reached the end of their useful life, while $952,192 was awarded to construct a vehicle storage facility.

Sens. Warner and Kaine have consistently supported policies designed to bring down energy costs and support the transition to cleaner fuels with less environmental impact, the release stated.

The Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act included billions of dollars to support the transition to electric and zero-emission cars and buses. The Inflation Reduction Act, which was passed by the Senate last week, also included significant provisions to support the adoption of a clean energy future, and is expected to reduce carbon emissions 40 percent by 2030.

162,"Governor joins Amazon, city officials in dedication, tour of new Suffolk facility",Suffolk News-Herald,https://www.suffolknewsherald.com/2022/10/21/governor-joins-amazon-city-officials-in-dedication-tour-of-new-suffolk-facility/,Suffolk,10/2022,"Amazon officials and City Council members gathered alongside Gov. Glenn Youngkin Thursday to celebrate the grand opening of Suffolk’s Amazon Robotics Fulfillment Center.
The new Suffolk facility is notable for being 3.8 million square feet and is the second largest building in the state of Virginia.
The grand opening included a press conference, music by the Nansemond River High School band, and a facility tour that explored the robotics technology that employees use to better enhance Amazon customer service. It also brought Amazon Vice President of Worldwide Economic Development and Public Policy Holly Sullivan and Suffolk Fulfillment Center General Manager of Operations Gregory Lum to town for the special event.
Gov. Youngkin spoke at the Thursday morning press conference alongside City Mayor Michael Duman, VP Sullivan, and Suffolk Fulfillment Center General Manager of Operations Gregory Lum to emphasize the importance of the new Amazon facility – from its use of technology, to promotion of new jobs for the city of Suffolk.
“Today we have a chance to peek inside the amazing capabilities that drive Amazon’s ability to provide extraordinary customer service, to provide state of the art access and opportunities to customers,” Youngkin said. “What this represents is an opportunity to step back and not think about the size, the scale and the scope of this amazing facility. But to think about that moment, when those two words are uttered. 1,500 people – ‘you’re hired.’ 1,500 families. When someone gets hired, it’s not just an individual, it’s family.”
The governor said there are no greater words, other than when a loved one says “I do” when they ask you to marry them, than when they hear those words, “you’re hired.”
“Let’s just think through this, 1,500 great jobs, right here. Opportunity,” Youngkin said. “The ability to pursue dreams, the ability to support families comprehensively, and I just want to thank Amazon for thinking about not just how to hire people, but how to give them a career and how to make sure they have a fulfilling life.”
Sullivan explained Amazon’s investment in Virginia.
“Our presence in Virginia means more than just those great jobs with full benefits provided within the fulfillment center’s four walls,” Sullivan said. “We’ve invested more than $34 billion dollars across the state in fulfillment and cloud infrastructure through compensation towards our thousands of our employees.”
Those investments, she said, have helped create more than 96,000 indirect jobs and other trade in services such as logistics and construction.
Mayor Duman also took the time to thank those who support the Amazon project and to express how the facility will benefit the city’s future.
“As you can imagine, our city code never envisioned a 90 foot tall, 3.8 million square foot robotics fulfillment center,” he said. “In addition, I would like to thank our plan reviewers, building officials, and fire marshall who took on this challenging task and worked diligently to get us to where we are today.”
Duman said the city is thankful for the company’s monumental success, the economic impact through job creation and generated tax revenue will be significant for years to come.
“We are indeed fortunate to welcome a corporate partner of this caliber to this part of our community,” he said. “As mayor of this diverse and dynamic city, I am often reminded how far we have come and how far we have yet to go.”
Lum, a Virginia Military Institute alum, former member of the Virginia National Guard, and commissioned as a logistics officer, then discussed the importance of his employees and development of new jobs in the city of Suffolk.
“Each day, our employees play an integral role in delivering smiles to our customers and they work in concert with our operation colleagues at the cross-dock fulfillment center in Chesapeake, just down the road, and delivery stations in Hampton, Norfolk, and Chesapeake,” Lum said.Once the Suffolk operation launched last month, Lum said it created more than 1,500 new, full-time jobs here.
“Amazonians who work here make an average starting rate of over $16 an hour and we’re proud to offer compensation packages to our frontline employees that not only include good pay, but also provide comprehensive benefits on day one for all of these regular full-time employees,” he said.
Lum also provided details to the benefits that Amazon employees receive for their work during the conference.
“Benefits include health, vision, and dental insurance from day one. A 401K plan with 50% company match, up to 20 weeks of paid leave, which includes 14 weeks of pregnancy, related disability leave or six weeks of parental leave,” he said. Additionally, there’s a mental health benefit that supports their workers and their families.
“We believe so strongly in investing in the long term success of our employees and the communities in which we operate.”
During the conference, Lum also announced that Amazon will be making a monetary donation to the Nansemond River High School band to thank them for coming out for the celebration.

the new suffolk facility is notable for being 3 8 million square feet and is the second largest building in the state of virginia 
the grand opening included a press conference  music by the nansemond river high school band  and a facility tour that explored the robotics technology that employees use to better enhance amazon customer service  it also brought amazon vice president of worldwide economic development and public policy holly sullivan and suffolk fulfillment center general manager of operations gregory lum to town for the special event 
gov  youngkin spoke at the thursday morning press conference alongside city mayor michael duman  vp sullivan  and suffolk fulfillment center general manager of operations gregory lum to emphasize the importance of the new amazon facility – from its use of technology  to promotion of new jobs for the city of suffolk 
“today we have a chance to peek inside the amazing capabilities that drive amazon’s ability to provide extraordinary customer service  to provide state of the art access and opportunities to customers ” youngkin said  “what this represents is an opportunity to step back and not think about the size  the scale and the scope of this amazing facility  but to think about that moment  when those two words are uttered  1 500 people – ‘you’re hired ’ 1 500 families  when someone gets hired  it’s not just an individual  it’s family ”
the governor said there are no greater words  other than when a loved one says “i do” when they ask you to marry them  than when they hear those words  “you’re hired ”
“let’s just think through this  1 500 great jobs  right here  opportunity ” youngkin said  “the ability to pursue dreams  the ability to support families comprehensively  and i just want to thank amazon for thinking about not just how to hire people  but how to give them a career and how to make sure they have a fulfilling life ”
sullivan explained amazon’s investment in virginia 
“our presence in virginia means more than just those great jobs with full benefits provided within the fulfillment center’s four walls ” sullivan said  “we’ve invested more than $34 billion dollars across the state in fulfillment and cloud infrastructure through compensation towards our thousands of our employees ”
those investments  she said  have helped create more than 96 000 indirect jobs and other trade in services such as logistics and construction 
mayor duman also took the time to thank those who support the amazon project and to express how the facility will benefit the city’s future 
“as you can imagine  our city code never envisioned a 90 foot tall  3 8 million square foot robotics fulfillment center ” he said  “in addition  i would like to thank our plan reviewers  building officials  and fire marshall who took on this challenging task and worked diligently to get us to where we are today ”
duman said the city is thankful for the company’s monumental success  the economic impact through job creation and generated tax revenue will be significant for years to come 
“we are indeed fortunate to welcome a corporate partner of this caliber to this part of our community ” he said  “as mayor of this diverse and dynamic city  i am often reminded how far we have come and how far we have yet to go ”
lum  a virginia military institute alum  former member of the virginia national guard  and commissioned as a logistics officer  then discussed the importance of his employees and development of new jobs in the city of suffolk 
“each day  our employees play an integral role in delivering smiles to our customers and they work in concert with our operation colleagues at the cross-dock fulfillment center in chesapeake  just down the road  and delivery stations in hampton  norfolk  and chesapeake ” lum said once the suffolk operation launched last month  lum said it created more than 1 500 new  full-time jobs here 
“amazonians who work here make an average starting rate of over $16 an hour and we’re proud to offer compensation packages to our frontline employees that not only include good pay  but also provide comprehensive benefits on day one for all of these regular full-time employees ” he said 
lum also provided details to the benefits that amazon employees receive for their work during the conference 
“benefits include health  vision  and dental insurance from day one  a 401k plan with 50% company match  up to 20 weeks of paid leave  which includes 14 weeks of pregnancy  related disability leave or six weeks of parental leave ” he said  additionally  there’s a mental health benefit that supports their workers and their families 
“we believe so strongly in investing in the long term success of our employees and the communities in which we operate ”
during the conference  lum also announced that amazon will be making a monetary donation to the nansemond river high school band to thank them for coming out for the celebration

163,Suffolk Center receives technology grant,Suffolk News-Herald,https://www.suffolknewsherald.com/2021/04/16/suffolk-center-receives-technology-grant/,Suffolk,04/2021,"Suffolk Center for Cultural Arts has virtually reinvented the arts during this pandemic to continue to provide a forum where diverse audiences can actively participate in cultural experiences.

Over the past year, the Center created live-streaming “Together on Stage” music concerts, virtual art exhibitions, more than 100 virtual arts education videos and implemented new ways to support local artists with online shopping. The Suffolk Center’s virtual transformations were made possible thanks to a generous grant from the Birdsong Trust, providing much-needed upgrades to the Center’s information technology capabilities.

The Birdsong Trust grant honors a friend of the Suffolk community, John Harrell, who died in November 2019 after a long battle with cancer. He was known for his quick wit, generous spirit and as a smart businessman and owner of Suffolk Iron Works Inc. John Harrell served as a Suffolk Center Board of Directors and his efforts were integral in the transformation of Suffolk High School into the area’s only full-service Cultural Arts Center.

“This gift made by the Birdsong Trust Fund precisely epitomizes the type of gift that our beloved former Chairman John Harrell would have ‘jumped on’ as it reflects the very essence of the mission statement for which the Birdsong Trust Fund was originally created — to help worthy projects of local organizations who then help the citizens of Suffolk and the surrounding area,” said Billy Chorey, current chairman of the Birdsong Trust Fund. “Yes indeed, my good friend would have loved this and in many ways, I strongly believe he does in fact know.”

Thanks to the Birdsong Trust’s gracious award, the Center has purchased 14 new computers and monitors with built-in cameras so that the staff could participate in Zoom meetings. The Center also installed new Wi-Fi access points throughout the 73,000 square foot building to provide additional bandwidth and internet speed for Suffolk students participating in remote learning during the Suffolk Arts Enrichment Program and Renaissance School of the Arts homeschoolers classes held on-site.

“On behalf of the Suffolk Center’s board of directors and staff, we are greatly appreciative of the Birdsong Trust’s $23,540 grant to the Suffolk Center in memory of their past president, and our mutual friend, John Harrell, who served on the first Board of Directors for the Suffolk Center 20 years ago and was a steadfast supporter of the Center until his passing in 2019,” said Susan Lawrence, Suffolk Center’s retired executive director. “Because of John’s connection with the Suffolk Center, it was our honor for Birdsong Trust to consider remembering him in some way here.”

Donations are a wonderful way to honor or memorialize a friend or loved one. Contributions, no matter the amount, make an impact and support Suffolk Center for Cultural Arts education programs to outstanding activities, exhibitions and performances.

164,Technology available at libraries and recreation centers,Suffolk News-Herald,https://www.suffolknewsherald.com/2020/12/10/technology-available-at-libraries-and-recreation-centers/,Suffolk,12/2020,"Suffolk residents will soon have access once again to public computers while following safety protocols.

With COVID-19 shutting down public spaces, many Suffolk residents have not had proper access to technology that they may need. Suffolk Libraries and Suffolk Parks and Recreation are offering access to computers, printing and other technology to the Suffolk community. Access will begin on Dec. 14.

“Access to technology is a great need in our community, especially during COVID-19, and we are pleased to be able to provide access to a variety of options including internet accessible computers in our libraries and recreation centers,” said Clint Rudy, director of libraries for Suffolk Public Libraries.

Morgan Memorial and North Suffolk Library will open for technology use only from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. Monday through Friday and Saturdays from 10 a.m. to 1 p.m. To keep social distancing, patrons must check in when entering. Face coverings are required for entering, as is a health assessment. There will be a one-hour time limit, and due to social distancing, staff will be unable to provide one-on-one assistance. The rest of the building will remain closed as curbside services will continue.

“Additionally, tablets to take home and laptops for use on the property are available at two locations of the Suffolk Public Library,” said Rudy.

To meet demands and follow social distancing, Kindle Fire tablets are available for check out and home use for up to three weeks with a library account. Laptops will also be available for checkout on library property. These items, including the WiFi2Go mobile hotspots, may be requested through curbside pickup services. Laptops are available on a first-come, first-served basis and cannot be placed on hold in advance.

Printing is also available through curbside service for no-contact pickup. Email documents to reference@suffolkva.us indicating the number of copies and preferred pickup location.

Individuals can sign up for a free library card online through the library’s website to immediately access digital content and place holds on print materials.

According to Rudy, the library is preparing for classes, events and new additions to help the Suffolk community stay connected.

Suffolk Parks and Recreation will have computer labs available from 6 a.m. to noon, and 1 to 8 p.m., Monday through Friday, and 8 a.m. to noon on Saturdays at East Suffolk and Whaleyville recreation centers. The lab will close from noon to 1 p.m. for disinfecting, but cleaning will also occur while labs are open.

Face coverings must be worn when entering and using computers. Health screenings will take place, and no one with a temperature above 100.4 degrees will be permitted. Patrons must register before entering, and a maximum of two may be allowed at a time for a one-hour time slot.

East Suffolk and Whaleyville Recreation Center computer labs are available for use with an annual Recreation Center membership. Recreation Center memberships for residents are $20 per year for adults, $10 per year for teens, and $5 per year for seniors ages 55 and up.

The East Suffolk Recreation Center is located at 138 S. Sixth St., and the Whaleyville Recreation Center is located at 132 Robertson St.

165,A not-so-trivial pursuit: SHS student’s art goes worldwide in ‘Trivia Knight’ game,Smithfield Times,https://www.smithfieldtimes.com/2022/11/04/a-not-so-trivial-pursuit-smithfield-high-students-art-goes-worldwide-in-trivia-knight-game/,Smithfield,11/2022,"Smithfield High School senior Elizabeth DeFluri has always been captivated by art.

When the COVID-19 pandemic shuttered Virginia’s schools in the middle of her freshman year, drawing, and specifically graphic design, became her creative outlet for dealing with the isolation.

“The pandemic really opened my eyes to the significance art has in the world and I developed a reverence for the designs and concepts people take for granted daily,” DeFluri said.

Over the past three years, she’s created posters, logos and T-shirt designs for her school, and has even interned as a graphic designer with Isle of Wight County Schools’ communications coordinator, David Elliott. When Kris Warshefski, lead developer of the internationally used foreign language teaching website Voces Digital, asked teachers from around the world to nominate a student to design graphics for Voces’ new “Trivia Knight” game, only one name came to Smithfield High School Spanish teacher Jill Vargas’ mind.

“I knew of her internship she did with Mr. Elliott and the county and her passion for graphic design,” Vargas said. “being a teacher is more than just teaching ‘content’ but actually knowing your student’s passions and supporting them.”

Warshefski ultimately chose DeFluri for the project. By the end of the year, when Trivia Knight debuts, students and teachers from all over the United States and the world will have seen DeFluri’s work.

Warshefski describes Trivia Knight as “a game where students take up the role of a knight to try to gather treasure from trivia-obsessed dragons.”

Spanish, French and English-as-a-second-language teachers who use the game in their classes will be able to choose pre-built question sets or create their own.

DeFluri created graphics depicting three different-sized piles of treasure, a knight’s helmet and two dragon heads, one breathing fire, using the Procreate computer program. DeFluri’s work will be credited on Voces’ website.

“I am very grateful to have been presented with an opportunity to have my work published by Voces,” DeFluri said. “It means so much to me that my art will benefit students and teachers from all other the world.”

DeFluri experimented with multiple designs, then revised her chosen concept several times before the graphics arrived at their final form.

On the fire-breathing dragon graphic, “I initially drew the flames too small and had to redraw them a total of three times to get them as fierce as the Voces team imagined they should be,” DeFluri said.

DeFluri plans to attend Virginia Commonwealth University’s School of the Arts after graduation and continue working in graphic design.

She is the daughter of Susan and Paul DeFluri of Smithfield.","['smithfield', 'high', 'school', 'senior', 'elizabeth', 'defluri', 'has', 'always', 'been', 'captivated', 'by', 'art', 'when', 'the', 'covid-19', 'pandemic', 'shuttered', 'virginia’s', 'schools', 'in', 'the', 'middle', 'of', 'her', 'freshman', 'year', 'drawing', 'and', 'specifically', 'graphic', 'design', 'became', 'her', 'creative', 'outlet', 'for', 'dealing', 'with', 'the', 'isolation', '“the', 'pandemic', 'really', 'opened', 'my', 'eyes', 'to', 'the', 'significance', 'art', 'has', 'in', 'the', 'world', 'and', 'i', 'developed', 'a', 'reverence', 'for', 'the', 'designs', 'and', 'concepts', 'people', 'take', 'for', 'granted', 'daily', '”', 'defluri', 'said', 'over', 'the', 'past', 'three', 'years', 'she’s', 'created', 'posters', 'logos', 'and', 't-shirt', 'designs', 'for', 'her', 'school', 'and', 'has', 'even', 'interned', 'as', 'a', 'graphic', 'designer', 'with', 'isle', 'of', 'wight', 'county', 'schools’', 'communications', 'coordinator', 'david', 'elliott', 'when', 'kris', 'warshefski', 'lead', 'developer', 'of', 'the', 'internationally', 'used', 'foreign', 'language', 'teaching', 'website', 'voces', 'digital', 'asked', 'teachers', 'from', 'around', 'the', 'world', 'to', 'nominate', 'a', 'student', 'to', 'design', 'graphics', 'for', 'voces’', 'new', '“trivia', 'knight”', 'game', 'only', 'one', 'name', 'came', 'to', 'smithfield', 'high', 'school', 'spanish', 'teacher', 'jill', 'vargas’', 'mind', '“i', 'knew', 'of', 'her', 'internship', 'she', 'did', 'with', 'mr', 'elliott', 'and', 'the', 'county', 'and', 'her', 'passion', 'for', 'graphic', 'design', '”', 'vargas', 'said', '“being', 'a', 'teacher', 'is', 'more', 'than', 'just', 'teaching', '‘content’', 'but', 'actually', 'knowing', 'your', 'student’s', 'passions', 'and', 'supporting', 'them', '”', 'warshefski', 'ultimately', 'chose', 'defluri', 'for', 'the', 'project', 'by', 'the', 'end', 'of', 'the', 'year', 'when', 'trivia', 'knight', 'debuts', 'students', 'and', 'teachers', 'from', 'all', 'over', 'the', 'united', 'states', 'and', 'the', 'world', 'will', 'have', 'seen', 'defluri’s', 'work', 'warshefski', 'describes', 'trivia', 'knight', 'as', '“a', 'game', 'where', 'students', 'take', 'up', 'the', 'role', 'of', 'a', 'knight', 'to', 'try', 'to', 'gather', 'treasure', 'from', 'trivia-obsessed', 'dragons', '”', 'spanish', 'french', 'and', 'english-as-a-second-language', 'teachers', 'who', 'use', 'the', 'game', 'in', 'their', 'classes', 'will', 'be', 'able', 'to', 'choose', 'pre-built', 'question', 'sets', 'or', 'create', 'their', 'own', 'defluri', 'created', 'graphics', 'depicting', 'three', 'different-sized', 'piles', 'of', 'treasure', 'a', 'knight’s', 'helmet', 'and', 'two', 'dragon', 'heads', 'one', 'breathing', 'fire', 'using', 'the', 'procreate', 'computer', 'program', 'defluri’s', 'work', 'will', 'be', 'credited', 'on', 'voces’', 'website', '“i', 'am', 'very', 'grateful', 'to', 'have', 'been', 'presented', 'with', 'an', 'opportunity', 'to', 'have', 'my', 'work', 'published', 'by', 'voces', '”', 'defluri', 'said', '“it', 'means', 'so', 'much', 'to', 'me', 'that', 'my', 'art', 'will', 'benefit', 'students', 'and', 'teachers', 'from', 'all', 'other', 'the', 'world', '”', 'defluri', 'experimented', 'with', 'multiple', 'designs', 'then', 'revised', 'her', 'chosen', 'concept', 'several', 'times', 'before', 'the', 'graphics', 'arrived', 'at', 'their', 'final', 'form', 'on', 'the', 'fire-breathing', 'dragon', 'graphic', '“i', 'initially', 'drew', 'the', 'flames', 'too', 'small', 'and', 'had', 'to', 'redraw', 'them', 'a', 'total', 'of', 'three', 'times', 'to', 'get', 'them', 'as', 'fierce', 'as', 'the', 'voces', 'team', 'imagined', 'they', 'should', 'be', '”', 'defluri', 'said', 'defluri', 'plans', 'to', 'attend', 'virginia', 'commonwealth', 'university’s', 'school', 'of', 'the', 'arts', 'after', 'graduation', 'and', 'continue', 'working', 'in', 'graphic', 'design', 'she', 'is', 'the', 'daughter', 'of', 'susan', 'and', 'paul', 'defluri', 'of', 'smithfield']","['creative', 'significance', 'reverence', 'even', 'passion', 'just', 'ultimately', 'will', 'will', 'able', 'will', 'grateful', 'opportunity', 'will', 'benefit']","['isolation', 'game', 'game', 'dragons', 'game', 'dragon', 'dragon', 'fierce']",11.0,2022.0,"smithfield high school senior elizabeth defluri has always been captivated by art

According to County Administrator Melissa Rollins, Surry’s current system dates to 1999. Its proposed replacement, Munis, is the same software Isle of Wight County uses.

The new Munis program, manufactured by Tyler Technologies, would remove “a lot of the manual processes” county staff must currently use, and would “provide more transparency in our reporting,” Rollins said.

According to a quote Tyler Technologies provided Surry County, transitioning to Munis would be a multiyear process that would entail $550,248 in one-time fees plus $136,854 in annual recurring fees for a contract total of $960,810. Tyler also estimated an additional $35,620 in travel expenses to send its people to Surry to work with the county’s staff.

A final agreement between Tyler and Surry would still be subject to approval by the county’s attorney, Rollins said. The new software would handle accounting, payroll and human resources management for the county, its school system and its Department of Social Services. It would also handle permitting, and potentially allow residents to apply for permits online rather than have to come in person to the county’s Planning and Community Development Department.

The transition to the new software will be phased in, starting in 2023.

In 2019, Smithfield and Isle of Wight County Tourism scrapped the town’s Olden Days festival in favor of a more inclusive and family-oriented event.

Then came the COVID-19 pandemic, resulting in the replacement event’s cancellation in 2020 and again in 2021.

When the town held its last Olden Days in June 2018, soaring temperatures caused several heat-related medical emergencies requiring the Isle of Wight Volunteer Rescue Squad’s intervention. Connie Chapman, tourism’s special events coordinator, had hoped to beat the heat by moving the festival to May. But nature had other plans, with temperatures on Saturday reaching into the low 90s.

“The temperatures kept a lot of people away this time, but I think for the first time, it went well,” said Chapman, who estimated attendance at 1,500 people.

The event included live theatrical performances. At the 1750 Isle of Wight Courthouse, local reenactors in colonial attire performed “Trial by Jury,” a play written by the late Doris Gwaltney based on an actual Isle of Wight County court case from the late 1700s. Outside Perfectly Natural Soap on Main Street, the Tidewater Dogs of War showed up in medieval armor despite the heat. The group of full-contact medieval duel reenactors includes members from Richmond to the North Carolina border.

Artists and crafters exhibited their wares along Main Street, which was closed to traffic for the occasion, while music and dance groups performed on the gazebo stage outside the Smithfield Times building.

Catherine Minga won best in show in the juried art contest, judged by Linda Glasscock Bunch, executive director of the Suffolk Art League.

Other awards were as follows:

First place, photography: Sharon Hardy
Second place, photography: Mike O’Shell
First place, painting: Randall Maynard
Second place, painting: Tammy Burgett
First place, 3D: John Tobin

Named for the time in British history spanning 1811-1820 when King George III was declared unfit to rule and his son, the Prince of Wales, was appointed regent, the society describes itself online as wanting to recapture “the spirit of that elegant age.”

For many, Kanell included, that means wearing clothing of the era when the society gets invited to events like the one on April 17 at Bacon’s Castle in Surry County.

Preservation Virginia, the privately-funded statewide organization that now owns Bacon’s Castle, hosts the Regency Society annually as its kickoff to the state’s Historic Garden Week, which spans April 17-24 this year. The circa-1665 homestead boasts the oldest formal English garden in North America and the oldest brick dwelling on the continent.

Heather Kenney, a fellow society member and Jane Austen novel enthusiast, traveled all the way from Winchester in the northwestern part of the state to attend. She’s a second-generation Regency member who’s been dressing in bonnets and lace gowns since age 3.

Along the way, she met up with William Buser of Fredericksburg, who’s been a member since 2000.

“I just love history,” Buser said.

Kenney’s costume came from Colonial Williamsburg, while Buser had his custom-made by a seamstress from Ohio.

Preservation Virginia also invites a group of artists to paint the scene every year. As of last year, they’re officially known as the Newport News Urban Sketchers, a local chapter of an international organization of “plein air” artists, the term referring to the act of drawing or painting outdoors.

Mandy Lewis-Houston, the local chapter’s organizer, said the idea is to paint where you live, and capture “what’s really going on,” including the mundane aspects of everyday life, like fire hydrants, cars and people walking by.

Chris Hakanson, who teaches art and animation at Phoebus High School in Hampton, is another of the chapter’s members. He started drawing with colored pencils in 2007 and later graduated to working with acrylic paints.

The event also featured an archery demonstration and some local vendors, including Jennifer Helton of the Claremont Candle Company and Brian and Kristin Curry of Vintner’s Catalyst in Carrollton.","['jamie', 'kanell', 'a', 'native', 'of', 'england', 'who', 'now', 'lives', 'in', 'norfolk', 'describes', 'her', 'involvement', 'with', 'the', 'regency', 'society', 'of', 'virginia', 'as', '“a', 'little', 'piece', 'of', 'home', '”', 'named', 'for', 'the', 'time', 'in', 'british', 'history', 'spanning', '1811-1820', 'when', 'king', 'george', 'iii', 'was', 'declared', 'unfit', 'to', 'rule', 'and', 'his', 'son', 'the', 'prince', 'of', 'wales', 'was', 'appointed', 'regent', 'the', 'society', 'describes', 'itself', 'online', 'as', 'wanting', 'to', 'recapture', '“the', 'spirit', 'of', 'that', 'elegant', 'age', '”', 'for', 'many', 'kanell', 'included', 'that', 'means', 'wearing', 'clothing', 'of', 'the', 'era', 'when', 'the', 'society', 'gets', 'invited', 'to', 'events', 'like', 'the', 'one', 'on', 'april', '17', 'at', 'bacon’s', 'castle', 'in', 'surry', 'county', 'subscribe', 'to', 'our', 'free', 'email', 'newsletter', 'get', 'the', 'latest', 'news', 'sent', 'to', 'your', 'inbox', 'email', 'address', 'preservation', 'virginia', 'the', 'privately-funded', 'statewide', 'organization', 'that', 'now', 'owns', 'bacon’s', 'castle', 'hosts', 'the', 'regency', 'society', 'annually', 'as', 'its', 'kickoff', 'to', 'the', 'state’s', 'historic', 'garden', 'week', 'which', 'spans', 'april', '17-24', 'this', 'year', 'the', 'circa-1665', 'homestead', 'boasts', 'the', 'oldest', 'formal', 'english', 'garden', 'in', 'north', 'america', 'and', 'the', 'oldest', 'brick', 'dwelling', 'on', 'the', 'continent', 'heather', 'kenney', 'a', 'fellow', 'society', 'member', 'and', 'jane', 'austen', 'novel', 'enthusiast', 'traveled', 'all', 'the', 'way', 'from', 'winchester', 'in', 'the', 'northwestern', 'part', 'of', 'the', 'state', 'to', 'attend', 'she’s', 'a', 'second-generation', 'regency', 'member', 'who’s', 'been', 'dressing', 'in', 'bonnets', 'and', 'lace', 'gowns', 'since', 'age', '3', 'along', 'the', 'way', 'she', 'met', 'up', 'with', 'william', 'buser', 'of', 'fredericksburg', 'who’s', 'been', 'a', 'member', 'since', '2000', '“i', 'just', 'love', 'history', '”', 'buser', 'said', 'kenney’s', 'costume', 'came', 'from', 'colonial', 'williamsburg', 'while', 'buser', 'had', 'his', 'custom-made', 'by', 'a', 'seamstress', 'from', 'ohio', 'preservation', 'virginia', 'also', 'invites', 'a', 'group', 'of', 'artists', 'to', 'paint', 'the', 'scene', 'every', 'year', 'as', 'of', 'last', 'year', 'they’re', 'officially', 'known', 'as', 'the', 'newport', 'news', 'urban', 'sketchers', 'a', 'local', 'chapter', 'of', 'an', 'international', 'organization', 'of', '“plein', 'air”', 'artists', 'the', 'term', 'referring', 'to', 'the', 'act', 'of', 'drawing', 'or', 'painting', 'outdoors', 'mandy', 'lewis-houston', 'the', 'local', 'chapter’s', 'organizer', 'said', 'the', 'idea', 'is', 'to', 'paint', 'where', 'you', 'live', 'and', 'capture', '“what’s', 'really', 'going', 'on', '”', 'including', 'the', 'mundane', 'aspects', 'of', 'everyday', 'life', 'like', 'fire', 'hydrants', 'cars', 'and', 'people', 'walking', 'by', 'chris', 'hakanson', 'who', 'teaches', 'art', 'and', 'animation', 'at', 'phoebus', 'high', 'school', 'in', 'hampton', 'is', 'another', 'of', 'the', 'chapter’s', 'members', 'he', 'started', 'drawing', 'with', 'colored', 'pencils', 'in', '2007', 'and', 'later', 'graduated', 'to', 'working', 'with', 'acrylic', 'paints', 'the', 'event', 'also', 'featured', 'an', 'archery', 'demonstration', 'and', 'some', 'local', 'vendors', 'including', 'jennifer', 'helton', 'of', 'the', 'claremont', 'candle', 'company', 'and', 'brian', 'and', 'kristin', 'curry', 'of', 'vintner’s', 'catalyst', 'in', 'carrollton']","['spirit', 'elegant', 'free', 'historic', 'novel', 'enthusiast', 'just', 'love', 'live', 'catalyst']","['little', 'unfit', 'mundane']",4.0,2021.0,"jamie kanell  a native of england who now lives in norfolk  describes her involvement with the regency society of virginia as “a little piece of home ”

The three story house, now the home of Home Sweet Home Care in downtown Smithfield, was where three women artists got together and created the Collage Studios and Gallery in 1991.

Fast forward 27 years and the Arts League not only has a permanent facility closer to the business center — the Arts Center @ 319 — it also has under its umbrella three other arts venues — the Smithfield Summer Concert Series, Smithfield Music and Sundays at Four.

Today, the Arts Center alone gets from 13,000 to 14,000 visitors a year, according to Director Sheila Gwaltney. {mprestriction ids=”1,2,3,4,5,6″}

Another perk is the partnership between the Arts Center and Isle of Wight County Tourism, which shares the space for its Visitor Center.

“It’s like an old, happy marriage,” said Isle of Wight Tourism Director Judy Winslow of the space the two entities have shared since 2009. The Arts Center and Visitor Center moved into what was formerly Winn Hardware.

The shared space, which also includes a public restroom, allows tourism to become an attraction on its own, and the tourism traffic adds to the number of visitors to the Arts Center, Winslow said.

“It’s been a win-win situation,” she said.

Prior to 1991, there weren’t any visual arts venues in town, said Ann Hubbard, one of the founding members of the Collage and Isle of Wight Arts League.

There was an arts organization, the Brush and Palette Club, but Hubbard and co-founders, Carolyn Taylor and Sandra Killette, wanted a permanent venue for artists to work and show their art.

The women saw the solution in the then rather run down Victorian, which is located across from where Hubbard lives and runs her studio and gallery, Color Scapes.

Owners Lanny and Diane Hinson, who also live on Main Street, let the women rent the house and fix it up — and the roomy residence had lots of space to grow, Hubbard said.

The house was outfitted with galleries, a gift shop and classroom downstairs and artist’s studios upstairs. Hubbard credits the Hinsons for being generous with the house and their support in making it work in the early days.

When the Arts League decided to purchase the house, they were able to get enough donations for the down payment, Hubbard said, adding that other local artists, such as Ed Condra and Jack Dashiell were enthusiastic about the project.

At its heyday, the Collage had a rotating program every six weeks, as well as art classes and a summer camp for children.  

“It was a struggle, financially. But we always paid our bills on time,” said Hubbard.

In 2007, Gwaltney became director of the Collage and jokes that it’s her fault that the Arts League ended up moving to its present location.

Gwaltney became intrigued by the arts program in Harrisonburg that was built on partnerships and revitalizing old buildings into new uses. At the same time, the Antiques Emporium in Smithfield closed, as did Winn Hardware, and Winslow wanted to move tourism into a larger facility. Prior to the move, Tourism was located where Encore Pilates and Physical Therapy is now.

Nine months later the two organizations moved in, Gwaltney said, adding that the move allowed the center to stay open more hours, had better parking and was more handicap accessible.

“It really boosted our visitation,” she said.

The addition of the other venues, such as the Summer Concert Series, began before she became director. Sundays at Four was the last to join in 2010.

The other venues joined the Arts League to take advantage of its non-profit status, said Jim Abicht, who heads up Smithfield Music. Smithfield Music brings known musicians of many varieties to Smithfield, notably the annual Aiken and Friends Music Fest, and proceeds benefit music education in Isle of Wight County.  

It also allowed one entity to spread the word about all of its venues at the same time, he said.

The Arts Center still boasts a gift shop, resident artists, shows and arts classes.

Gwaltney said the plan is to add a juried art show, an outdoor art show and getting regional and state artists to display their work in an attempt to add new exhibits.

“We’re trying to up our game,” Gwaltney said.

 

Recollections of an earlier era 
One Smithfield resident remembers the arts in Smithfield decades before there was a non-profit Arts League or even the Smithfield Little Theatre.

Sundays at Four founder Mary Cole remembers that her mother, Catherine Yeoman Edwards was growing up with Ruth Haverty and Kitty and Louise Langhorne, the Chapmans and many other families that were very active in creating artistic outlets to Smithfield. That was around 1910 to the 1930s, Cole said.

There was an adult men’s choir and a music club for women through the 1950s, said Cole.

And a century ago, a barge presenting musicals and plays also traveled to Smithfield along the Pagan River, Cole said.

The James Adams Floating Theatre came to town before World War I and tied up at the dock at the foot of Main Street for a week, according to “Smithfield, A Pictorial History,” by Segar Cofer Dashiell.

Church music and school music shared a scene together until sometime in the late 60’s when there was a big push for the separation of the religious element from the schools, Cole recalls.

The Smithfield Little Theatre got its start in 1962 with a group that produced children’s theater with the Smithfield Recreation Association.

“Throughout our history, since the beginning of the 20th century, and even earlier, the arts brought people together. They are about community and are very therapeutic for all ages,” said Cole.

the three story house  now the home of home sweet home care in downtown smithfield  was where three women artists got together and created the collage studios and gallery in 1991 

fast forward 27 years and the arts league not only has a permanent facility closer to the business center — the arts center @ 319 — it also has under its umbrella three other arts venues — the smithfield summer concert series  smithfield music and sundays at four 

today  the arts center alone gets from 13 000 to 14 000 visitors a year  according to director sheila gwaltney  {mprestriction ids=”1 2 3 4 5 6″}

another perk is the partnership between the arts center and isle of wight county tourism  which shares the space for its visitor center 

“it’s like an old  happy marriage ” said isle of wight tourism director judy winslow of the space the two entities have shared since 2009  the arts center and visitor center moved into what was formerly winn hardware 

the shared space  which also includes a public restroom  allows tourism to become an attraction on its own  and the tourism traffic adds to the number of visitors to the arts center  winslow said 

“it’s been a win-win situation ” she said 

prior to 1991  there weren’t any visual arts venues in town  said ann hubbard  one of the founding members of the collage and isle of wight arts league 

there was an arts organization  the brush and palette club  but hubbard and co-founders  carolyn taylor and sandra killette  wanted a permanent venue for artists to work and show their art 

the women saw the solution in the then rather run down victorian  which is located across from where hubbard lives and runs her studio and gallery  color scapes 

owners lanny and diane hinson  who also live on main street  let the women rent the house and fix it up — and the roomy residence had lots of space to grow  hubbard said 

the house was outfitted with galleries  a gift shop and classroom downstairs and artist’s studios upstairs  hubbard credits the hinsons for being generous with the house and their support in making it work in the early days 

when the arts league decided to purchase the house  they were able to get enough donations for the down payment  hubbard said  adding that other local artists  such as ed condra and jack dashiell were enthusiastic about the project 

at its heyday  the collage had a rotating program every six weeks  as well as art classes and a summer camp for children   

“it was a struggle  financially  but we always paid our bills on time ” said hubbard 

in 2007  gwaltney became director of the collage and jokes that it’s her fault that the arts league ended up moving to its present location 

gwaltney became intrigued by the arts program in harrisonburg that was built on partnerships and revitalizing old buildings into new uses  at the same time  the antiques emporium in smithfield closed  as did winn hardware  and winslow wanted to move tourism into a larger facility  prior to the move  tourism was located where encore pilates and physical therapy is now 

nine months later the two organizations moved in  gwaltney said  adding that the move allowed the center to stay open more hours  had better parking and was more handicap accessible 

“it really boosted our visitation ” she said 

the addition of the other venues  such as the summer concert series  began before she became director  sundays at four was the last to join in 2010 

the other venues joined the arts league to take advantage of its non-profit status  said jim abicht  who heads up smithfield music  smithfield music brings known musicians of many varieties to smithfield  notably the annual aiken and friends music fest  and proceeds benefit music education in isle of wight county   

it also allowed one entity to spread the word about all of its venues at the same time  he said 

the arts center still boasts a gift shop  resident artists  shows and arts classes 

gwaltney said the plan is to add a juried art show  an outdoor art show and getting regional and state artists to display their work in an attempt to add new exhibits 

“we’re trying to up our game ” gwaltney said 

 

recollections of an earlier era 
one smithfield resident remembers the arts in smithfield decades before there was a non-profit arts league or even the smithfield little theatre 

sundays at four founder mary cole remembers that her mother  catherine yeoman edwards was growing up with ruth haverty and kitty and louise langhorne  the chapmans and many other families that were very active in creating artistic outlets to smithfield  that was around 1910 to the 1930s  cole said 

there was an adult men’s choir and a music club for women through the 1950s  said cole 

and a century ago  a barge presenting musicals and plays also traveled to smithfield along the pagan river  cole said 

the james adams floating theatre came to town before world war i and tied up at the dock at the foot of main street for a week  according to “smithfield  a pictorial history ” by segar cofer dashiell 

church music and school music shared a scene together until sometime in the late 60’s when there was a big push for the separation of the religious element from the schools  cole recalls 

the smithfield little theatre got its start in 1962 with a group that produced children’s theater with the smithfield recreation association 

“throughout our history  since the beginning of the 20th century  and even earlier  the arts brought people together  they are about community and are very therapeutic for all ages ” said cole  ","['ate', 'be ', 'been', 'bling', 'cap', 'cat', 'class', 'dis', 'fam', 'hip', 'ion', 'lit', 'mans ', 'n', 'nd', 'race', 'rap', 'read', 'school', 'separation ', 'status ', 'struggle', 'unity ', 'wig', 'yo', '', '', '', '', '', '']",20,8,31,990

“This is a whole new initiative that we hope will attract all demographics to Smithfield as well as locals. The event will be “a celebration of visual, performing and culinary arts,” said Chapman. 

The former warm weather festival — Olden Days — has been permanently retired by tourism. {mprestriction ids=”1,2,3,4,5,6″}

The event kicks off Thursday, May 14 as the Smithfield Little Theatre winds down its performance of “Hands on a Hardbody,” which is about 10 Texans hoping to win a new truck by keeping their hand on one for the longest amount of time, and was inspired by a true story. 

Already, Tourism is asking visual artists to submit works in a variety of fine art mediums, such as watercolors, as well a photography and three-dimensional works such as pottery and jewelry. Prizes will be awarded. 

The visual arts will be part of a juried show along Main Street on Saturday, May 16, along with performing and culinary arts activities, said Chapman. 

Local dance studios will perform on The Smithfield Times gazebo stage on Saturday, along with restaurants and bakeries offering possible culinary demonstrations and other activities. 

Musical performances are also on the list, said Chapman. 

The deadline for submissions for the juried show is Nov. 10 and there is a $35 application fee. Jury selection is announced Dec. 10.

173,Quilted with stitches of love ,Smithfield Times,https://www.smithfieldtimes.com/2021/02/02/quilted-with-stitches-of-love/,Smithfield,02/2021,"Smithfield’s Angel Quilters have blessed nearly 1,000 people with warmth, comfort and creativity.

Over the past three years, the volunteer group, which is based at Trinity United Methodist Church and includes church members as well as people not directly connected to the congregation, has stitched together a strong network of community backers and organizations that support the group’s mission to provide a quilt for kids in need in or around Smithfield or Isle of Wight County.

Now anyone in the community has an opportunity to see and acquire one of the group’s quilts. The Arts Center @ 319 on Main Street in downtown Smithfield has about 35 quilts on exhibit through the end of February. The quilts are also for sale.

The art exhibit emerged from an earlier partnership, Julie Hopkins, one of the quilting group’s leaders, explained. Angel Quilters was selling face masks through the visitors center and she started talking with Sheila Gwaltney, the arts center’s director, who liked the idea.

“We thought, January and February would be a great time to do this,’ Gwaltney said. “Art enriches our lives in so many ways, but quilts are special,” she said.

The exhibit — “Baby It’s Cold Outside” — seems aptly named for the season, a perfect time to appreciate the beauty, craftsmanship and heart behind the creation of quilts with bright colors and scenes of spring and summer.

As of last week, “we’ve actually sold nine quilts out of here, but when we did this we really didn’t think we would sell them so fast.,” Hopkins said. “We wanted people to come into the art center and enjoy our quilts. But obviously they’re enjoying them by taking them home.”

As group member Nancy Trudeau explains, Angel Quilters got a serendipitous start through an unintentional social faux pas that everyone involved took very lightheartedly On her first Sunday at Trinity after moving to Virginia from Georgia, Hopkins “chased me down after church because I had sat in ‘her pew,’ and she invited me to lunch.”

During their meal, Trudeau shared that she was a quilter and wanted to connect with other people who shared her craft and passion. Hopkins, in turn, shared that she’d been working on a quilt for her son for several years, and Trudeau agreed to help. Trudeau also shared that she was part of a quilting group in Georgia and wanted to join one here.

“Julie said there wasn’t one in Smithfield and that we should start one,” Trudeau said. After advertising in the church bulletin and the newspaper, 13 people showed up at the first meeting. Now the group is more than 30 strong.

Before the pandemic, the group would sit in a church annex building with sewing machines. Since the pandemic, just a few people gather at a time, and interactions are more logistically oriented — drop-offs and pickups of material and quilts. “We don’t have people coming and staying and sitting and sewing during COVID,” Trudeau said. “But we will again someday, we hope.”

Initially, the group charged everyone $3 to participate to cover the cost of supplies, but word about the organization’s mission and talent got around. Now they receive enough donated materials to provide everything needed to produce the quilts.

Angel Quilters supports many local organizations, including Genieve Shelter, Christian Outreach Program, Court Appointed Special Advocates for kids, the Isle of Wight Rescue Squad and sheriff’s office and All God’s Children camps, just to name a few. They also donate quilts to individual children that the group learns about through the church and community feedback.

Quilts were also on display in the sanctuary at Trinity. Hopkins said they were set to receive a formal blessing before being provided to a recipient. The church has “been very supportive of us,” Trudeau said.

When the group started, they connected with Quilters Dream, which makes quilt batting. “They don’t give it to us for free, but they give us a very good price.” The batting is an essential element of a quilt — t’s the middle layer that makes it puffy.

Angel Quilters makes the tops and backing of the quilt, inserts the batting and then sends the quilt out for longarm work, where the three parts of the quilt are put together on a large machine that’s operated by hand.

Trudeau worked for many years as an architect. She credits a friend in California for introducing her to quilting. “There are a lot of similarities if you look at all these things. There are a lot of squares and rectangles and triangles and stuff, so measuring and cutting and that kind of thing,” she said.

The art league’s gallery is open 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. Monday through Saturday and noon to 4 p.m. Sunday.

over the past three years  the volunteer group  which is based at trinity united methodist church and includes church members as well as people not directly connected to the congregation  has stitched together a strong network of community backers and organizations that support the group’s mission to provide a quilt for kids in need in or around smithfield or isle of wight county 

now anyone in the community has an opportunity to see and acquire one of the group’s quilts  the arts center @ 319 on main street in downtown smithfield has about 35 quilts on exhibit through the end of february  the quilts are also for sale

the art exhibit emerged from an earlier partnership  julie hopkins  one of the quilting group’s leaders  explained  angel quilters was selling face masks through the visitors center and she started talking with sheila gwaltney  the arts center’s director  who liked the idea 

“we thought  january and february would be a great time to do this ’ gwaltney said  “art enriches our lives in so many ways  but quilts are special ” she said 

the exhibit — “baby it’s cold outside” — seems aptly named for the season  a perfect time to appreciate the beauty  craftsmanship and heart behind the creation of quilts with bright colors and scenes of spring and summer 

as of last week  “we’ve actually sold nine quilts out of here  but when we did this we really didn’t think we would sell them so fast  ” hopkins said  “we wanted people to come into the art center and enjoy our quilts  but obviously they’re enjoying them by taking them home ”

as group member nancy trudeau explains  angel quilters got a serendipitous start through an unintentional social faux pas that everyone involved took very lightheartedly on her first sunday at trinity after moving to virginia from georgia  hopkins “chased me down after church because i had sat in ‘her pew ’ and she invited me to lunch ”

during their meal  trudeau shared that she was a quilter and wanted to connect with other people who shared her craft and passion  hopkins  in turn  shared that she’d been working on a quilt for her son for several years  and trudeau agreed to help  trudeau also shared that she was part of a quilting group in georgia and wanted to join one here 

“julie said there wasn’t one in smithfield and that we should start one ” trudeau said  after advertising in the church bulletin and the newspaper  13 people showed up at the first meeting  now the group is more than 30 strong 

before the pandemic  the group would sit in a church annex building with sewing machines  since the pandemic  just a few people gather at a time  and interactions are more logistically oriented — drop-offs and pickups of material and quilts  “we don’t have people coming and staying and sitting and sewing during covid ” trudeau said  “but we will again someday  we hope ”

initially  the group charged everyone $3 to participate to cover the cost of supplies  but word about the organization’s mission and talent got around  now they receive enough donated materials to provide everything needed to produce the quilts 

angel quilters supports many local organizations  including genieve shelter  christian outreach program  court appointed special advocates for kids  the isle of wight rescue squad and sheriff’s office and all god’s children camps  just to name a few  they also donate quilts to individual children that the group learns about through the church and community feedback 

quilts were also on display in the sanctuary at trinity  hopkins said they were set to receive a formal blessing before being provided to a recipient  the church has “been very supportive of us ” trudeau said 

when the group started  they connected with quilters dream  which makes quilt batting  “they don’t give it to us for free  but they give us a very good price ” the batting is an essential element of a quilt — t’s the middle layer that makes it puffy 

angel quilters makes the tops and backing of the quilt  inserts the batting and then sends the quilt out for longarm work  where the three parts of the quilt are put together on a large machine that’s operated by hand 

trudeau worked for many years as an architect  she credits a friend in california for introducing her to quilting  “there are a lot of similarities if you look at all these things  there are a lot of squares and rectangles and triangles and stuff  so measuring and cutting and that kind of thing ” she said

A street closing request for an autumn vintage market spurred Arts Center Director Sheila Gwaltney to raise concerns about its management.

Gwaltney spoke Monday at the Smithfield Town Council Police Committee meeting about the request, which calls for 7,000 attendees and 60 vendors to be spread out over the 100-300 blocks of Main Street in downtown Smithfield.

The event is scheduled for Saturday, Sept. 30 from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m. Market Manager Cheryl Ketcham is requesting that the street be closed from 6 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. that day.

Armed with photos from last year’s Christmas market, Gwaltney said a vendor set up tents and blocked off the Arts Center @319, which significantly reduced visibility and traffic to the facility. {mprestriction ids=”1,2,3,4,5,6″}

It’s private property, Gwaltney said.

Gwaltney said that when she was finally able to speak with Ketcham, she was told it was “too much trouble” to make the vendor move.

“She was in her shop at her cash register,” said Gwaltney, referring to Ketcham’s business, Findley’s General Store, where she invited Smithfield Farmers Market vendors to set up permanent displays.

Ketcham also manages the weekly Smithfield Farmers Markets.

Another issue is that the Christmas market had planned on 80 vendors but about 120 showed up, Gwaltney said.

Gwaltney accused Ketcham of lacking “situational awareness” and told the Council committee that “more oversight needs to be done.”

The reality of more than 80 vendors “will be a big headache to residents and vendors on Main Street,” Gwaltney said.

Gwaltney said she didn’t know who to complain to about the issue, adding that the weekly Farmers Markets, confined to the parking lot of Bank of Southside Virginia, do not cause a problem, but the sprawling street markets create challenges.

Ketcham and Isle of Wight County Director of Tourism Judy Winslow did not respond to a request for comment by press time.

Smithfield Town Council member Milton Cook said the farmers and specialty markets fall under tourism, which is run by Isle of Wight County.

All Smithfield does is contribute money to the agency, and “we do not have direct authority,” Cook said.

Smithfield Town Council member Randy Pack said it was important to pay attention to Gwaltney’s concerns.

The town doesn’t want to run off downtown merchants in favor of out-of-town vendors, he said.

Parks and Recreation Director Amy Musick withdrew the application and said that in light of Gwaltney’s concerns, the issue would be discussed at next week’s Special Events Committee meeting, which considers event applications before they go to the Town Council.

The special events committee, which reviews applications for events, is appointed by Mayor Carter Williams and includes town council members, town staff, tourism staff and members of the Smithfield Police Department.

In an interview last year with The Smithfield Times, Ketcham described the markets as similar to a “small business” that receives a monetary contribution from the town of Smithfield and budgetary oversight from Isle of Wight County.

Ketcham’s salary and other expenses are dependent upon vendor fees.

This year, Ketcham and Tourism made a concession concerning its spring vintage market by moving it to the Isle of Wight County fairgrounds near Windsor.","['managing', 'editor', 'a', 'street',

What we didn’t understand at the time was that we were also listening to a social revolution in the making, one that would positively affect the entire nation as the years went by.

Most of us were listening to the early days of rock and roll back in the mid 1950s, locally finding it on WGH, located in Newport News. Dick Lamb, Bob Calvert and Gene Loving, among others, kept the discs turning.

The local black teenagers of that still-segregated era were listening to WRAP out of Norfolk, where Jack “Big Daddy” Holmes and Jay Dee Jackson spun R&B as well as rock and roll and where they could hear black college football games as well as religious shows.

Many of us were still pre-teens when the first truly big wave of the revolution hit in 1956. That was the year that a long-haired kid from Tennessee stepped onto the national music scene with “Heartbreak Hotel.”

Popular music would never be the same after that. During the next three years, Elvis Presley recorded 10 Number One hit songs, including “Don’t Be Cruel,” “Love Me Tender,” and “Jailhouse Rock.” That was more than double what anyone else had accomplished.

Others stepped out at that time, many of them recording at tiny Sun Records in Nashville. Among them were Johnny Cash and Jerry Lee Lewis.

The second big revolution was the British Invasion in 1964, when the Beatles put their signature on rock and roll and drew crowds that even outshined Elvis.

And yet, despite their success and undeniable influence on popular music, both the rock and roll giants of the 1950s, led by Presley, and the Beatles after them stood on the shoulders of others.

To back up, the early country music legends on one track and the blues singers on another brought together elements that were then used to build rock and roll. Blues, in particular, had a huge influence on what happened. B.B. King, Muddy Waters and a lot more blues and gospel singers, many that you never heard of, directly influenced Elvis, and the Beatles would later give credit to the same roots for their music.

And, while white kids were listening to Elvis and other early great white performers, they were also finding their thrill on “Blueberry Hill” with Fats Domino and dancing to “Johnny Be Good” with Chuck Berry.

Then, in the late 1950s, in a nation still racially segregated, a tiny recording company was founded up in Detroit. Motown records quickly brought us the Marvelettes, singing “Please Mr. Postman.” And a bit later, the Supremes gave us “Baby Love” and The Four Tops recorded “Reach Out, I’ll Be There.”

And that, in many ways, was the true social revolution in music because, even in a still-segregated South, kids both black and white were listening to these recording artists of both races, and enjoying the heck out of the music.

Each summer for more than three decades, this newspaper and the Isle of Wight Arts League have presented community concerts on the newspaper’s front lawn. One of our primary goals has always been to bring the community together by offering music of numerous genres. In recent years, the effort has begun to pay off as a more and more diverse audience come to listen to blues, jazz, America, big band and country performers.

All of us — the performers as well as the audience — owe a huge debt to these early musicians for beginning to bring America together. I don’t think it goes too far out on a limb to say that the U.S. Military, school integration and the popular music world did more to bring our diverse culture together than any just about anything else.","['whether', 'we', 'were', 'listening', 'to', 'an', 'early', 'transistor', 'radio', 'or', 'a', 'one-at-a-time', 'record', 'player', 'teenagers', 'of', 'the', '1950s', 'and', '1960s', 'were',

most of us were listening to the early days of rock and roll back in the mid 1950s  locally finding it on wgh  located in newport news  dick lamb  bob calvert and gene loving  among others  kept the discs turning 

the local black teenagers of that still-segregated era were listening to wrap out of norfolk  where jack “big daddy” holmes and jay dee jackson spun r&b as well as rock and roll and where they could hear black college football games as well as religious shows 

many of us were still pre-teens when the first truly big wave of the revolution hit in 1956  that was the year that a long-haired kid from tennessee stepped onto the national music scene with “heartbreak hotel ”

popular music would never be the same after that  during the next three years  elvis presley recorded 10 number one hit songs  including “don’t be cruel ” “love me tender ” and “jailhouse rock ” that was more than double what anyone else had accomplished 

others stepped out at that time  many of them recording at tiny sun records in nashville  among them were johnny cash and jerry lee lewis 

the second big revolution was the british invasion in 1964  when the beatles put their signature on rock and roll and drew crowds that even outshined elvis 

and yet  despite their success and undeniable influence on popular music  both the rock and roll giants of the 1950s  led by presley  and the beatles after them stood on the shoulders of others 

to back up  the early country music legends on one track and the blues singers on another brought together elements that were then used to build rock and roll  blues  in particular  had a huge influence on what happened  b b  king  muddy waters and a lot more blues and gospel singers  many that you never heard of  directly influenced elvis  and the beatles would later give credit to the same roots for their music 

and  while white kids were listening to elvis and other early great white performers  they were also finding their thrill on “blueberry hill” with fats domino and dancing to “johnny be good” with chuck berry 

then  in the late 1950s  in a nation still racially segregated  a tiny recording company was founded up in detroit  motown records quickly brought us the marvelettes  singing “please mr  postman ” and a bit later  the supremes gave us “baby love” and the four tops recorded “reach out  i’ll be there ”

and that  in many ways  was the true social revolution in music because  even in a still-segregated south  kids both black and white were listening to these recording artists of both races  and enjoying the heck out of the music 

each summer for more than three decades  this newspaper and the isle of wight arts league have presented community concerts on the newspaper’s front lawn  one of our primary goals has always been to bring the community together by offering music of numerous genres  in recent years  the effort has begun to pay off as a more and more diverse audience come to listen to blues  jazz  america  big band and country performers 

all of us — the performers as well as the audience — owe a huge debt to these early musicians for beginning to bring america together  i don’t think it goes too far out on a limb to say that the u s  military  school integration and the popular music world did more to bring our diverse culture together than any just about anything else ","['ate', 'be ', 'been', 'black', 'cat', 'culture', 'dis', 'hit ', 'integration ', 'ion', 'lit', 'n', 'nd', 'paper ', 'race', 'rack', 'rap', 'roll ', 'school', 'sis', 'unity ', 'wig', 'yo', '', '', '', '', '', '']",24,9,29,673
176,Museum video series online hit ,Smithfield Times,https://www.smithfieldtimes.com/2020/11/24/museum-video-series-online-hit/,Smithfield,11/2020,"If a picture is worth a thousand words, videos are probably exponentially more expressive.

The Isle of Wight County Museum has turned to two of today’s preferred platforms — video and social media — to help share and preserve the community’s stories, people and places as part of a recently debuted video series, “Behind These Walls.”

Produced by the museum and hosted by Kathy Mountjoy of the Smithfield and Isle of Wight Convention & Visitors Bureau, the series is focused on some of the county’s most interesting and significant structures.

“Isle of Wight has a tremendous amount of stories that are wonderful to share,” said museum director Jennifer England. The videos, she added, “seem like the perfect format.” The museum has produced videos for several years and also has the Ham Cam, doing a live video every Tuesday and Thursday on its Facebook page. “Once COVID hit, I thought instead of doing it in front of the Ham Cam, we can use Facebook to go mobile, so once I was able to go mobile with all of this, I thought there’s nothing to stop us now.”

So far, the museum has featured Four Square, a residence in Smithfield’s historic district that dates to 1807; Christ Episcopal Church, which was established in 1832 and recently renovated; the William D. Folk House, which was built in 1876; and Oak Level, which was built in several stages starting in 1768 near the Isle of Wight Court House. Several more videos are set to publish soon.

On a recent warm early fall day less than a week before Thanksgiving, England, Mountjoy, and museum curator Mike Holtzclaw visited another local landmark to capture its story — the Schoolhouse Museum.

“In a one-room schoolhouse this size, you could have from grade one through grade seven in one room with one teacher,” Phyllis Wellons, the Schoolhouse Museum’s docent, explained during a video taping session. “For the most part, that’s the way it was done.”

The Smithfield Schoolhouse Museum was built in 1932 as an addition to the Christian Home School, a Rosenwald school that dated to 1924. A century ago, Julius Rosenwald, a former president of Sears, Roebuck and Co., partnered with Booker T. Washington, a renowned Black educator and writer, to build thousands of schools in the south for Black students.

Local communities, including Isle of Wight residents, petitioned the county for money to expand the Christian Home School. This addition to the original Rosenwald building, which stood near Chuckatuck, was moved to Main Street in 2005 and opened as a museum in 2007. The remains of the 1924-era Rosenwald-funded building were unfortunately too deteriorated to preserve.

Wellons, a native of Isle of Wight County, said it’s often an eye-opening experience for young and old alike who may not appreciate how basic — even austere — rural one-room schoolhouses and education were a few generations ago.

Seeing firsthand how basic the building and services were back then may help today’s generation better appreciate how different things are today, “because you have everything right at your fingertips, so you are truly blessed.”

The teacher and students — who often walked miles to school — were expected to clean the building themselves. Older students often served as instructional assistants for the youngest students. Heat was provided by a wood or coal burning stove. Sometimes if there wasn’t any running water, students would fill up water buckets at a nearby home. And an outhouse was the school’s only restroom facility.

Before getting involved with the Schoolhouse Museum leadership, “I had never been inside of an old schoolhouse myself,” Wellons said. “When my mother went to school, they already had the first Black public high school built in this county, — it was Isle of Wight Training School,” she said. The school was later renamed Westside High School.

England said the museum is accepting suggestions on other Isle of Wight buildings to feature. The museum’s phone number is 757-356-1223.

177,Museum honors Black families who’ve made IW better ,Smithfield Times,https://www.smithfieldtimes.com/2022/03/02/museum-honors-black-families-whove-made-iw-better/,Smithfield,03/2022,"The Schoolhouse Museum began as an opportunity to preserve one of the little rural school buildings that once were the only avenue for Isle of Wight County’s Black children to achieve a basic education.

The building was a wing of the Christian Home School at Longview, which was established about a century ago. It was brought to Smithfield in 2005 and placed on a Main Street lot acquired from Dominion Resources. Within a couple of years, it had been restored, landscaped and furnished much as it and similar schools had been in those now-distant days.

The Schoolhouse Museum, however, is far more than a tiny wood-framed building. The nonprofit organization that grew out of that preservation effort today exists to record the educational journey of Isle of Wight’s African American community and to celebrate the numerous county residents who spent their lives ensuring that Black children would have opportunities that exceeded those of their parents and grandparents.

The museum sponsored a Black History Month event Saturday to recognize four families who are among the most prominent within the county’s African American community here and who have each made a contribution worthy of celebration.

 

The Thompsons

 

Fred D. Thompson was a Nelson County native who came to Isle of Wight to teach in the public school system after graduating from Virginia State. He became a school principal and served on both the Isle of Wight Recreation Facilities Authority and the county Planning Commission. Thompson’s wife, Ruby Warren Thompson of Zuni, became a career teacher and, after retirement, was a founding member of the Schoolhouse Museum.

Both Fred and Ruby encouraged generations of county students, but it’s through their children — Warren, Fred Jr. and Benita Thompson-Byas — that their greatest legacy is firmly established.

Warren Thompson, who holds a Master of Business Administration from the University of Virginia, founded Thompson Hospitality, the largest minority-owned food service and facilities management company in the country, operating restaurants and food service services in 48 states and four foreign countries.

Sister Benita serves as senior vice president in the company, overseeing Thompson Hospitality’s partnership with the Compass Group.

Fred Thompson Jr. is the company’s chief administrative officer and this year is serving as president of the Virginia Chamber of Commerce.

 

The Pretlows

Kenneth W. Pretlow was this family’s patriarch. He was instrumental, together with David Godwin and Frank Bowman, in purchasing land and deeding it to Isle of Wight County as the site for a new school for northern Isle of Wight’s Black students. Isle of Wight Training School was built on the property. Today, the site houses Westside Elementary School.

That drive to educate continued with generations of Pretlows. Kenneth’s daughter-in-law, Vivian, was the first teacher to teach French at Georgia Tyler School in Windsor. Harold’s daughter Carol served as project director for Norfolk State University’s first Defense Intelligence Agency contract, and Jocelyn Pretlow Goss taught and authored two books while doing so.

 

The Blounts

Richard H. Blount was a farmer and entrepreneur. He purchased 150 acres at Blount’s Corner, farmed the land and opened a store, R.H. Blount Country Store, one of the county’s legendary seats of rural commerce. He and his wife, the former Irene Spratley, operated the store and managed the farm while raising eight children.

Richard’s civic involvement centered on education. He became the first president of the Isle of Wight Training School PTA, which under his leadership obtained a school bus for the children north of Smithfield.

A portion of the Blount farm became the site of Hardy Elementary School, and the remainder of the farm was purchased by the county recently for construction of a new Hardy Elementary.

That focus on education and striving for excellence was passed down to later generations of Blounts. Grandson Brian is president of Union Presbyterian Seminary in Richmond. Grandson Richard is a retired Dominion Power executive. Jeffrey Blount is a retired news director at NBC and a nationally acclaimed novelist. Granddaughter Marquetta Brown-Cagg is also an author. The family includes athletes, medical professionals, paramedics, teachers and other professionals.

 

The Wilkersons

Ashland Wilkerson and his wife, Dorothy Delk, were business leaders in the once-thriving Black business district on Wharf Hill.

Ashland owned the shoe repair shop on Wharf Hill, which was operated for many years by Paul Williams. He worked with his brother-in-law, DuBois Herrings. He was active in the Smithfield Elks Lodge #65, which was headquartered on the second floor of the building that now houses Wharf Hill Brewery. Ashland was also choir master and organist for Hill Street Baptist Church.

Mrs. Wilkerson owned the Paradise Inn, a popular diner located on Wharf Hill.

178,Planners OK expanding solar farm in southern Isle of Wight,Smithfield Times,https://www.smithfieldtimes.com/2022/10/31/planners-ok-expanding-solar-farm-in-southern-isle-of-wight/,Smithfield,10/2022,"Developers looking to add acreage to a planned solar farm received a favorable vote from Isle of Wight County’s Planning Commission on Oct. 25.

Colorado-based SolarGen USA LLC had received approval from Isle of Wight supervisors in 2019 to build a 55-megawatt, 300-acre project named the Ho-Fel solar farm on Lees Mill Road near International Paper’s Franklin mill. Asheville, North-Carolina-based Pine Gate Renewables has since purchased the project – which has yet to break ground – and is now proposing to expand the facility by 18 acres.

According to Matt Boerger, Pine Gate’s project permitting manager, the original proposal had called for  fixed-position solar panels, whereas Pine Gate is now proposing to use the type that rotate to follow sunlight. The project will still have roughly the same amount of land covered by solar panels, but the panels will be spaced further apart to facilitate their motion, which is why more land is needed, Boerger said.

The redesign would lower the anticipated output from 55 megawatts to 40, which Pine Gate contends is still enough to power up to 6,000 homes. The generated electricity would be fed into Dominion Energy’s power grid.

According to Scott Foster, a member of Pine Gate’s legal team, the county would receive just over $207,000 in taxes over the next 40 years from the land were it left in its current agricultural state. Under Isle of Wight’s default machinery and tools tax rate, the project would generate $2.8 million over its 40-year lifespan. Pine Gate has proposed a siting agreement offering an additional $1,400-per-megawatt revenue sharing payment, which will increase by 10% every five years, bringing roughly $4.5 million in total revenue to the county over the project’s lifespan.

There is a cemetery located on the site, for which the company has pledged to maintain 24-hour access.

Ahead of the vote, the Commission held a public hearing, which drew only one speaker: David Tucker of Old Stage Highway.

Tucker inquired about stormwater management, testing of the site’s soil and water for any toxins leaching from the panels, and whether the panels would be manufactured in China.

According to Ashley Wall of the engineering firm Kimley-Horn, the conversion of agricultural land to what she termed “meadow” condition for a solar farm “actually creates a decrease in the peak runoff from the site, so you actually have less water leaving the site.”

According to Boerger, Pine Gate’s procurement contract with its solar panel manufacturers states the panels may not contain “hazardous materials,” defining the term as  exceeding the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s parts-per-million threshold for chromium, lead and other heavy metals. The panels are manufactured in four Asian countries, but “not China,” he said.

“There’s just not domestic manufacturing options right now,” Boerger said.

Commissioner Thomas Distefano motioned to recommend the project’s approval on the condition that the panels be “tested for hazardous constituents, using laboratory testing such as a TCLP,” that a sign be posted at the project site providing contact information for a local project manager, and that the field be cut by Aug. 1 annually if allowed to go fallow prior to construction of the solar farm. 

A Toxicity Characterization Leaching Procedure, or TCLP, test according to the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, tests damaged and end-of-life panels to determine if they will leach toxic metals.

According to Boerger, Pine Gate personnel will inspect the panels for damage once or twice a month, and remotely via computer software.

“Our goal is to generate enough power, and we know it when these things aren’t performing at optimal performance,” Boerger said.

Distefano’s motion passed unanimously with Commissioner Rick Sienkiewicz absent.

The matter will head to Isle of Wight’s Board of Supervisors for a final decision Nov. 17. If approved, Pine Gate anticipates the project would come online within the next year to 18 months.","['developers', 'looking', 'to', 'add', 'acreage', 'to', 'a', 'planned', 'solar', 'farm',

The redesign would lower the anticipated output from 55 megawatts to 40, which Pine Gate contends is still enough to power up to 6,000 homes. The generated electricity would be fed into Dominion Energy’s power grid.

According to Scott Foster, a member of Pine Gate’s legal team, the county would receive just over $207,000 in taxes over the next 40 years from the land were it left in its current agricultural state. Under Isle of Wight’s default machinery and tools tax rate, the project would generate $2.8 million over its 40-year lifespan. Pine Gate has proposed a siting agreement offering an additional $1,400-per-megawatt revenue sharing payment, which will increase by 10% every five years, bringing roughly $4.5 million in total revenue to the county over the project’s lifespan.

There is a cemetery located on the site, for which the company has pledged to maintain 24-hour access.

Ahead of the vote, the Commission held a public hearing, which drew only one speaker: David Tucker of Old Stage Highway.

Tucker inquired about stormwater management, testing of the site’s soil and water for any toxins leaching from the panels, and whether the panels would be manufactured in China.

According to Ashley Wall of the engineering firm Kimley-Horn, the conversion of agricultural land to what she termed “meadow” condition for a solar farm “actually creates a decrease in the peak runoff from the site, so you actually have less water leaving the site.”

According to Boerger, Pine Gate’s procurement contract with its solar panel manufacturers states the panels may not contain “hazardous materials,” defining the term as  exceeding the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s parts-per-million threshold for chromium, lead and other heavy metals. The panels are manufactured in four Asian countries, but “not China,” he said.

“There’s just not domestic manufacturing options right now,” Boerger said.

Commissioner Thomas Distefano motioned to recommend the project’s approval on the condition that the panels be “tested for hazardous constituents, using laboratory testing such as a TCLP,” that a sign be posted at the project site providing contact information for a local project manager, and that the field be cut by Aug. 1 annually if allowed to go fallow prior to construction of the solar farm. 

A Toxicity Characterization Leaching Procedure, or TCLP, test according to the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, tests damaged and end-of-life panels to determine if they will leach toxic metals.

According to Boerger, Pine Gate personnel will inspect the panels for damage once or twice a month, and remotely via computer software.

“Our goal is to generate enough power, and we know it when these things aren’t performing at optimal performance,” Boerger said.

Distefano’s motion passed unanimously with Commissioner Rick Sienkiewicz absent.

The matter will head to Isle of Wight’s Board of Supervisors for a final decision Nov. 17. If approved, Pine Gate anticipates the project would come online within the next year to 18 months.
